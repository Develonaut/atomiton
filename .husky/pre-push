# Husky pre-push hook - Minimal checks only

# Pre-push should be lightweight since all critical checks
# are now handled in pre-commit

echo "ðŸ“¤ Preparing to push..."

# Optionally, you could add a quick sanity check here
# For now, we just pass through since pre-commit handles everything

echo "âœ… Ready to push!"
