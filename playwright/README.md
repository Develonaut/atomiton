# Playwright E2E Tests

This directory contains root-level end-to-end tests for the Atomiton monorepo.

## Overview

These tests ensure that all applications in the monorepo can:
- Start up successfully
- Render their main content
- Navigate between routes
- Handle basic interactions
- Serve static assets properly

## Structure

```
playwright/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ smoke.spec.ts      # Basic smoke tests for client and UI
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ desktop.spec.ts    # Electron app tests (currently skipped)
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test-helpers.ts    # Shared test utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ fixtures/              # Test fixtures (future)
â””â”€â”€ playwright.config.ts   # Main configuration
```

## Running Tests

### Install Playwright
```bash
pnpm test:install
```

### Run All Tests
```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

### Run Specific Project
```bash
pnpm test:e2e --project=client
pnpm test:e2e --project=ui
```

### Run in UI Mode
```bash
pnpm test:e2e:ui
```

### Run in Headed Mode
```bash
pnpm test:e2e --headed
```

## Test Coverage

### âœ… Client App (`http://localhost:5173`)
- App loads and renders
- Navigation works
- No console errors
- Static assets served

### âœ… UI Package (`http://localhost:5174`)
- Component showcase loads
- Components render
- Interactive elements work
- No console errors

### ðŸš§ Desktop App
- Currently skipped (requires special Electron setup)
- Will be implemented in future iteration

## CI Integration

Tests are configured to run in CI with:
- Retries on failure (2 attempts)
- Single worker to avoid port conflicts
- Screenshots on failure
- Video on failure
- Trace on retry

## Development Tips

1. **Dev Servers**: Tests automatically start dev servers if not already running
2. **Reuse Servers**: Set `reuseExistingServer: true` to use already running servers
3. **Debugging**: Use `--debug` flag or `test.only` to focus on specific tests
4. **Screenshots**: Failed tests save screenshots to `playwright/screenshots/`

## Common Issues

### Port Conflicts
If you see port conflicts, kill existing processes:
```bash
pnpm kill-ports
```

### Timeout Issues
Increase timeout in config if dev servers take longer to start:
```typescript
webServer: {
  timeout: 180 * 1000, // 3 minutes
}
```

### Electron Tests
Desktop app tests require built app:
```bash
pnpm --filter @atomiton/desktop build
```
