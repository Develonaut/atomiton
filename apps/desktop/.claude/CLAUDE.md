# Desktop App - Claude Instructions

This is the **Electron desktop application** that wraps the Atomiton web UI.

## App Status

⚠️ **App exists but is not wired up yet**

We have Electron configuration from a previous implementation that will be integrated after the web UI is complete.

## What's Here

- Basic Electron setup
- Main process configuration
- Window management
- IPC setup (incomplete)

## Documentation

See [/docs/domains/desktop/](../../../docs/domains/desktop/) for desktop integration plans (if it exists).

## Current Priority

Not active - waiting for:

1. Beautiful web UI completion
2. Core functionality working
3. Then wrap in Electron

## Key Decisions

- Desktop-first approach (better than n8n's web-only)
- Full file system access
- Native OS integration
- Auto-updates via GitHub releases
