# Current Work - Desktop App

## Status

ðŸ”´ **Not Active** - Waiting for client app completion

## In Progress

Nothing currently - this app is on hold until the web UI is complete.

## Planned Architecture

### Electron Setup

- [ ] Main process configuration
- [ ] Preload script for security
- [ ] IPC communication setup
- [ ] Window management
- [ ] Menu bar configuration

### Desktop Features

- [ ] File system access
- [ ] Native OS integration
- [ ] System tray support
- [ ] Auto-updater setup
- [ ] Deep linking support

## Blockers

- Waiting for apps/client to be feature-complete
- Need Blueprint editor working in browser first
- UI framework must be finalized

## Notes

- Will wrap the Vite-built client app
- Desktop-first approach gives us advantages over n8n
- Full file system access for local workflow automation
- No cloud dependency - everything runs locally
- Will support auto-updates via GitHub releases
