# Completed - Desktop App

## 2025-09-02

### Initial Setup

- Created apps/desktop directory structure
- Added package.json with Electron dependencies
- Created placeholder electron.js file
- Added to monorepo structure
- Created .claude/CLAUDE.md documentation

## Previous Implementation

From earlier prototype (to be migrated):

- Basic Electron window creation
- Development vs production detection
- Window state management basics
- Simple IPC setup

## Notes

- Previous implementation exists but needs refactoring
- Will be properly integrated after client app is complete
- Desktop-first approach is a key differentiator from n8n
