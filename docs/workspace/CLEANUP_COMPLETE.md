# Documentation Cleanup Complete

## What We Did

### ✅ Removed

- All `/archive` folders (outdated content)
- `/docs/architecture` (duplicated in domains)
- `/docs/development` (outdated guidelines)
- `/docs/guidelines` (outdated)
- `/docs/strategies` (moved to workspace/strategies)
- Old TODO.md (replaced by workspace CURRENT/NEXT)
- Brainwave app code (will be neighbor repo)

### ✅ Preserved

- `/docs/domains/` - Main technical documentation
- `/docs/project/` - Project overview and roadmap
- `/docs/research/` - n8n and competitor analysis
- `/docs/workspace/` - Active development tracking
- Empty folders for future content (guides, reference, decisions)

### ✅ Added

- Proper credits (CREDITS.md)
- Brainwave 2.0 attribution
- workspace/.gitignore (only MONETIZATION_NOTES.md is private)
- Clear "hopes and dreams" disclaimer

## Final Structure

```
docs/
├── README.md          # Doc overview
├── domains/           # Technical architecture (main docs)
├── project/           # Project info (README, ROADMAP, SUSTAINABILITY)
├── research/          # Analysis (n8n, competitors)
├── workspace/         # Active work (CURRENT, NEXT, strategies)
├── decisions/         # Future: ADRs
├── guides/            # Future: User guides
└── reference/         # Future: API docs
```

## Why This is Better

1. **No duplication** - Single source of truth
2. **Clear structure** - Domains mirror packages
3. **Transparent planning** - Workspace is public
4. **Honest messaging** - "Nothing works yet"
5. **Proper attribution** - Credits where due

## Ready for Public

The documentation now:

- Sets correct expectations (very early stage)
- Shows transparent planning
- Credits inspirations properly
- Has clear structure
- Focuses on the vision
