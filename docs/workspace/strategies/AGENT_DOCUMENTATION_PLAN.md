# Agent Documentation Assignment Plan

## Overview

This plan assigns specific agents to flesh out domain documentation while ensuring consistency in formatting, tone, and messaging. All agents must maintain our respectful, learning-oriented approach to the industry.

## Documentation Standards

### Tone Guidelines

- **Respectful**: Industry leaders are inspirations, not competitors
- **Learning-focused**: What can we learn from their success?
- **Humble**: We're building something complementary, not revolutionary
- **Positive**: Focus on what we're building FOR, not against

### Formatting Standards

- **Headers**: Use consistent markdown hierarchy
- **Code blocks**: TypeScript with proper syntax highlighting
- **Tables**: For comparisons and metrics
- **Status badges**: 🔴 Not Started | 🟡 In Progress | 🟢 Complete
- **Dates**: ISO format (2025-01-02)

## Agent Assignments

- **SPECIAL**: Integration plan for existing packages (core, nodes, electron)

**Key Tasks**:

1. Document desktop platform capabilities
2. Define node plugin architecture
3. Create integration guide for existing packages
4. Handle IPC and cross-platform concerns

### 🧪 Brian - Testing Specialist

**Primary Responsibility**: Testing strategies and quality assurance

**Assigned Tasks**:

- Performance benchmarks and targets
- Integration test documentation
- E2E test scenarios for Blueprint editor

**Key Tasks**:

1. Define testing standards per domain
2. Create performance benchmarks
3. Document testing patterns
4. Ensure comprehensive coverage

### 🤖 Megamind - AI Integration Specialist

**Primary Responsibility**: AI-native features and integration

**Assigned Domains**:

- `/docs/domains/ai/` - AI integration layer
- AI assistance features across all domains
- Natural language to Blueprint conversion

**Key Tasks**:

1. Design AI-native architecture
2. Document LLM integration patterns
3. Create AI assistance guidelines
4. Define prompt engineering standards

## Existing Packages Integration

### What We Have

Based on your mention of existing packages:

- **core package**: Brain/API for entire application
- **nodes package**: Node library and implementations
- **electron package**: Desktop application wrapper

### Integration Strategy (Parker to lead)

#### Phase 1: Assessment (Immediate)

1. Add packages to monorepo without wiring
2. Assess current state and dependencies
3. Document what exists vs. what needs updating
4. Identify compatibility issues

#### Phase 2: Documentation (Week 1)

1. Document existing APIs and interfaces
2. Map to new domain structure
3. Identify gaps with n8n-inspired patterns
4. Create migration plan if needed

#### Phase 3: Gradual Integration (Week 2-4)

1. Start with core package (foundation)
2. Then nodes package (functionality)
3. Finally electron package (platform)
4. Test each integration thoroughly

### Package Placement

```
atomiton/
├── packages/
│   ├── core/          # ✅ From existing repository
│   ├── nodes/         # ✅ From existing repository
│   ├── electron/      # ✅ From existing repository
│   ├── @atomiton/di/  # 🔴 New (based on n8n pattern)
│   ├── @atomiton/workflow/ # 🔴 New
│   ├── @atomiton/editor/   # 🟡 Partially exists in apps/client
│   └── @atomiton/runtime/  # 🔴 New
```

## Coordination Guidelines

### For All Agents

1. **Check existing work** before creating new docs
2. **Reference n8n patterns** where applicable
3. **Maintain respectful tone** about competitors
4. **Use consistent formatting** per standards
5. **Cross-reference** related domains

### Communication Protocol

1. Update progress in domain README files
2. Use status badges for visibility
3. Note dependencies between domains
4. Flag conflicts for Barbara to resolve

## Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation

- Barbara: Structure and standards
- Michael: Core and DI domains
- Parker: Existing package assessment

### Week 2: Implementation

- Ryan: UI and editor documentation
- Brian: Testing strategies
- Megamind: AI integration patterns

### Week 3: Integration

- Parker: Wire up existing packages
- All: Review and refine documentation
- Barbara: Final consistency check

## Success Metrics

1. **Consistency**: All docs follow same format and tone
2. **Completeness**: Each domain has README, ROADMAP, and examples
3. **Clarity**: New developer understands architecture in < 30 min
4. **Respectful**: Zero negative mentions of competitors
5. **Actionable**: Every doc enables immediate work

## Notes

- Existing packages should be added but not wired up initially
- This preserves their code while we organize documentation
- Integration will be gradual and well-documented
- Focus on learning from n8n's successful patterns
