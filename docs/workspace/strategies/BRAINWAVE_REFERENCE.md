# Brainwave 2.0 Design Reference

## Official Resources

### Live Demo

**URL**: https://brainwave2-app.vercel.app/  
This is the reference implementation we're using as inspiration for Atomiton's UI.

### Design Assets (Purchased)

**Source**: https://ui8.net/ui8/products/brainwave-20-ai-powered-3d-ui-kit  
**What We Bought**:

- Figma design kit
- Code kit
- Commercial license for use in our project

## How We're Using It

### Inspiration, Not Copy

We're taking the Brainwave 2.0 aesthetic and:

1. **Adapting it** to our automation tool needs
2. **Converting it** to Mantine components
3. **Making it our own** with modifications for our use case
4. **Ensuring accessibility** and performance

### Key Elements We're Adopting

#### Visual Language

- Brainwave 2.0 aesthetic effects
- Gradient accents (purple/blue)
- Dark mode excellence
- Smooth animations
- Premium feel

#### Color Palette

```css
/* Extracted from Brainwave 2.0 */
--background-dark: #0a0a0b;
--background-card: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);
--accent-primary: #6366f1;
--accent-secondary: #8b5cf6;
--gradient-main: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
```

#### Component Patterns

- Brainwave 2.0 styled cards
- Gradient buttons
- Subtle hover states
- Smooth transitions
- Glow effects

## Attribution & License

### Our Approach

- ✅ **Purchased commercial license** - We have rights to use
- ✅ **Inspiration not replication** - Adapting for our needs
- ✅ **Open about source** - Not hiding where design comes from
- ✅ **Making it functional** - Converting design to working components

### What We're NOT Doing

- ❌ Direct code copying without modification
- ❌ Using assets without license
- ❌ Claiming original design
- ❌ Reselling the design kit

## Implementation Notes

### From Brainwave to Mantine

The Brainwave demo uses custom CSS and animations. We're:

1. Extracting the visual principles
2. Implementing them in Mantine's component system
3. Ensuring it works with our monorepo structure
4. Optimizing for desktop application performance

### Key Differences

| Brainwave 2.0  | Atomiton               |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Marketing site | Functional app         |
| Static design  | Interactive components |
| Web-only       | Desktop-first          |
| Custom CSS     | Mantine components     |
