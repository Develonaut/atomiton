## How to Use

### For Daily Work

1. Update `CURRENT.md` with what you're actively doing
2. Keep `NEXT.md` with upcoming work
3. Log blockers in `BLOCKERS.md` for Claude to help solve
4. Quick decisions go in `DECISIONS.md`

### For Claude Code Sessions

- Each session gets a date-stamped file in `sessions/`
- Copy important outcomes to permanent docs later
- Keep strategies in `strategies/` while active

## Current Focus

See [CURRENT.md](./CURRENT.md) for what's being worked on now.

## Why This Structure?

- **Simple**: Just markdown files, no tools needed
- **Claude-friendly**: AI can easily read and update
- **Git-friendly**: Easy to track changes
- **Solo-optimized**: No team coordination overhead

**Note**: This is for active work. Permanent documentation goes in `/docs/domains/` or `/docs/guides/`
