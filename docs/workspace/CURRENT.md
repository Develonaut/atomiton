# Current Work - September 4, 2025

## Active Focus

### Documentation Reorganization

**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

Reorganizing docs to domain-driven structure based on n8n analysis:

- âœ… Created domain structure
- âœ… Analyzed existing core package
- ðŸŸ¡ Creating domain READMEs and roadmaps
- ðŸ”´ Migrating existing content

### Package Integration

**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Complete

Added existing packages to monorepo with full Turborepo integration:

- âœ… core package added and integrated with Turborepo
- âœ… nodes package added and integrated with Turborepo
- âœ… electron package added
- âœ… theme package added
- âœ… All packages use Vite for consistent builds
- âœ… Shared ESLint and TypeScript configurations
- ðŸ”´ Not wired to UI yet (intentional - UI migration priority)

## Today's Goals

1. âœ… Review n8n analysis and extract patterns
2. âœ… Create domain-based documentation structure
3. âœ… Add existing packages to monorepo
4. âœ… Document domains and create roadmaps
5. âœ… Clarify Brainwave 2.0 theme (not Dracula)
6. âœ… Prioritize UI beauty over infrastructure

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Adopt n8n's @namespace pattern** - Clear boundaries
2. **Keep existing core code** - It's good architecture
3. **Domain-driven docs** - Mirror package structure
4. **Respectful competitor analysis** - Learn, don't criticize
5. **Use reflect-metadata for DI** - Like n8n, proven pattern
6. **Theme as single source of truth** - Mantine-based, feeds all components
7. **Migration order**: Vite â†’ Mantine â†’ Extract to packages
8. **Desktop-first naming** - apps/client not apps/web
9. **Full transparency** - Even monetization ideas are public

## Next Up

See [NEXT.md](./NEXT.md)

## Blockers

See [BLOCKERS.md](./BLOCKERS.md)

## Notes

- Existing core package has excellent patterns already
- Platform abstraction better than n8n (desktop-first)
- Storage clients align with n8n's abstraction approach
- Need to add DI pattern for better testing

## Recent Completed Work (September 4, 2025)

### UI Framework Decision

- âœ… Decided to build custom Tailwind-based UI framework instead of Mantine
- âœ… Created comprehensive strategy document for custom framework
- âœ… Framework will use React, Tailwind, Headless UI, and Compound Components
- âœ… Inspired by best patterns from Radix, Material UI, Mantine
- âœ… Focus on lightweight, CSS-first approach with zero runtime overhead

## Completed Work (September 4, 2025)

### Turborepo Integration

- âœ… Hooked up core and nodes packages to Turborepo
- âœ… Configured shared ESLint and TypeScript configs
- âœ… Migrated both packages from `tsc` to Vite builds
- âœ… Committed packages to git with proper formatting

### Vite Build Consistency

- âœ… All packages now use Vite for builds (core, nodes, theme, ui)
- âœ… Node.js targeting configured for core/nodes packages
- âœ… Proper externalization of Node.js modules
- âœ… Source maps and dual format (ES/CJS) outputs
