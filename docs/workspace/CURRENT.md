# Current Work - January 2, 2025

## Active Focus

### Documentation Reorganization

**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

Reorganizing docs to domain-driven structure based on n8n analysis:

- âœ… Created domain structure
- âœ… Analyzed existing core package
- ðŸŸ¡ Creating domain READMEs and roadmaps
- ðŸ”´ Migrating existing content

### Package Integration

**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Complete (not wired)

Added existing packages to monorepo:

- âœ… core package added
- âœ… nodes package added
- âœ… electron package added
- âœ… theme package added
- ðŸ”´ Not wired to UI yet (intentional)

## Today's Goals

1. âœ… Review n8n analysis and extract patterns
2. âœ… Create domain-based documentation structure
3. âœ… Add existing packages to monorepo
4. âœ… Document domains and create roadmaps
5. âœ… Clarify Brainwave 2.0 theme (not Dracula)
6. âœ… Prioritize UI beauty over infrastructure

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Adopt n8n's @namespace pattern** - Clear boundaries
2. **Keep existing core code** - It's good architecture
3. **Domain-driven docs** - Mirror package structure
4. **Respectful competitor analysis** - Learn, don't criticize
5. **Use reflect-metadata for DI** - Like n8n, proven pattern
6. **Theme as single source of truth** - Mantine-based, feeds all components
7. **Migration order**: Vite â†’ Mantine â†’ Extract to packages
8. **Desktop-first naming** - apps/client not apps/web
9. **Full transparency** - Even monetization ideas are public

## Next Up

See [NEXT.md](./NEXT.md)

## Blockers

See [BLOCKERS.md](./BLOCKERS.md)

## Notes

- Existing core package has excellent patterns already
- Platform abstraction better than n8n (desktop-first)
- Storage clients align with n8n's abstraction approach
- Need to add DI pattern for better testing
