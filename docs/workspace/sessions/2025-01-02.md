# Session: 2025-01-02

## Session Goals

- âœ… Analyze n8n architecture and extract patterns
- âœ… Reorganize documentation to domain-driven structure
- âœ… Add existing packages (core, nodes, electron, theme)
- ðŸŸ¡ Create domain documentation and roadmaps
- ðŸŸ¡ Dispatch agents for documentation tasks

## Context

### Last Session

- First major documentation session
- Starting fresh with lessons from n8n

### Current State

- Working on: Documentation reorganization
- Dependencies: None
- Constraints: Solo developer, side project

## Work Log

### Started: ~17:00

#### Task 1: n8n Analysis Review

**Status**: âœ… Complete
**Time**: 30 min
**Notes**:

- Identified key patterns: DI, namespace packages, streaming
- Found improvements: simpler deps, desktop-first, AI-native
- Documented learnings

#### Task 2: Documentation Reorganization

**Status**: âœ… Complete  
**Time**: 45 min
**Notes**:

- Created domain-driven structure
- Set up workspace for active development
- Created templates for consistency

#### Task 3: Package Integration

**Status**: âœ… Complete
**Time**: 20 min
**Notes**:

- Added core, nodes, electron, theme packages
- Not wired up (intentional)
- Analyzed existing core - it's good!

#### Task 4: Agent Dispatch

**Status**: âœ… Complete
**Time**: 30 min
**Notes**:

- Created AGENT_DOCUMENTATION_PLAN.md
- Dispatched Ryan for theme documentation
- Dispatched Michael for nodes documentation

#### Task 5: Monetization Strategy

**Status**: âœ… Complete
**Time**: 20 min
**Notes**:

- Created public SUSTAINABILITY.md
- Created private MONETIZATION_NOTES.md
- Balanced community-friendly with sustainable
- Focus on themes, Pro version, optional cloud

### Ended: ~18:30

## Outcomes

### Completed

- âœ… Documentation structure reorganized to domain-driven
- âœ… Existing packages added and documented
- âœ… Competitor analysis completed (respectful tone)
- âœ… Workspace structure created for solo dev
- âœ… Session template created
- âœ… Main README with "hopes and dreams" disclaimer
- âœ… Monetization strategy (donations first)
- âœ… Brainwave 2.0 theme clarified (not Dracula)
- âœ… .claude directories updated in packages
- âœ… Critical strategies preserved in workspace
- âœ… Docs folder cleaned up and organized

### Blocked/Deferred

- ðŸ“… Wiring packages (intentionally deferred)

## Key Decisions

1. **Use domain-driven docs**: Mirror package structure for clarity
2. **Keep existing core**: Good architecture, just needs DI
3. **Workspace directory**: For active work with Claude Code
4. **Respectful tone**: Industry leaders are inspirations

## Discoveries

- Existing core package already has patterns similar to n8n
- Platform abstraction is better than n8n (desktop-first)
- Storage clients align with n8n's approach naturally
- Our code is more valuable than expected!

## Code Changes

- `docs/domains/`: New structure created
- `docs/workspace/`: Active work directory
- `packages/core/`: Added from previous repo
- `packages/nodes/`: Added from previous repo
- `packages/electron/`: Added from previous repo
- `packages/theme/`: Added from previous repo

## Next Session

### Must Do

- [ ] Dispatch agents for domain docs
- [ ] Create DI package specification
- [ ] Document nodes package

### Should Do

- [ ] Create workflow domain spec
- [ ] Plan Vite migration execution
- [ ] Test existing packages build

### Could Do

- [ ] Start DI implementation
- [ ] Create first integration test

## Blockers for Next Time

- None identified

## Notes for Claude

- Use agents from AGENT_DOCUMENTATION_PLAN.md
- Keep respectful tone about competitors
- Focus on documentation before coding
- Remember existing packages aren't wired yet
