# Atomiton Development Roadmap

**Vision**: The desktop-first, AI-native automation platform that beats n8n through simplicity, performance, and modern architecture

**Created**: January 2, 2025  
**Status**: Strategic roadmap capitalizing on n8n analysis insights  
**Budget**: $0 (all free resources, user-powered compute)

---

## 1. Current State Assessment (Q1 2025 - Now)

### What We Have Built

- **Core Structure**: Functional monorepo with pnpm workspaces
- **UI Foundation**: Next.js app with React Flow integration
- **Theme System**: Complete Dracula theme package
- **Quality Pipeline**: Pre-commit hooks, linting, TypeScript strict mode
- **Build System**: Turborepo configured for fast builds
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive architecture docs and migration strategies

### Core Strengths to Build On

- **Modern Stack**: Already using pnpm, Turborepo (like n8n but newer)
- **Clean Codebase**: No technical debt yet, can make architectural decisions freely
- **Desktop-First Vision**: Clear differentiation from n8n's web complexity
- **AI-Native Planning**: Built for LLMs from day one (n8n retrofitted)

### Critical Gaps to Address

- **No Execution Engine**: Can't run workflows yet
- **Missing Core Package**: Brain/API from previous repo needs integration
- **Tech Debt**: Next.js overhead, Tailwind complexity
- **No Node System**: Need basic nodes for MVP
- **No Persistence**: Can't save/load Blueprints

---

## 2. Phase 1: Foundation (Q1 2025 - 3 Months)

### Goal: Working MVP that beats n8n in simplicity and developer experience

### Month 1: Architecture Alignment (January 2025)

**Week 1-2: Adopt n8n's Best Patterns**

- [ ] Restructure to @atomiton namespace pattern
  - `@atomiton/core` - Core functionality (from previous repo)
  - `@atomiton/workflow` - Execution engine
  - `@atomiton/nodes` - Node library (from previous repo)
  - `@atomiton/di` - Lightweight dependency injection
- [ ] Implement n8n-inspired interfaces
  ```typescript
  interface INode {
    execute(): Promise<INodeExecutionData>;
  }
  interface IWorkflow {
    nodes: INode[];
    execute(): Promise<IResult>;
  }
  ```
- [ ] Set up proper package boundaries (prevent accidental imports)

**Week 3-4: Fix Critical Technical Debt**

- [ ] Complete Vite migration (remove Next.js complexity)
  - 10x faster HMR than n8n's webpack
  - Simpler configuration
  - Better tree-shaking
- [ ] Start Mantine UI migration (better than Tailwind for data-heavy UIs)
  - n8n struggles with complex UI components
  - Mantine provides what n8n custom-built

### Month 2: Core Systems (February 2025)

**Week 5-6: Execution Engine (Better than n8n)**

- [ ] Build streaming execution engine
  - n8n limitation: Single-threaded, memory-heavy
  - Our advantage: Stream processing, lower memory
  - WebAssembly for compute-intensive nodes
- [ ] Implement job queue with p-queue
  - Simpler than n8n's Bull/Redis complexity
  - Works locally without infrastructure

**Week 7-8: Essential Nodes (10-15 nodes)**
Focus on quality over quantity (n8n has 500+ but most unused):

- [ ] **Data Nodes** (3-4):
  - JSON Transform (with AI assistance)
  - CSV Reader/Writer
  - File Operations
- [ ] **HTTP Nodes** (2-3):
  - HTTP Request (better error handling than n8n)
  - Webhook Trigger
  - API Builder (generate from OpenAPI)
- [ ] **AI Nodes** (3-4):
  - OpenAI (with streaming support)
  - Local LLM (Ollama integration)
  - Prompt Builder (visual prompt engineering)
- [ ] **Control Nodes** (2-3):
  - If/Else (visual branching)
  - Loop (with performance limits)
  - Delay/Schedule

### Month 3: Desktop Polish (March 2025)

**Week 9-10: Electron App**

- [ ] Native file system access (n8n can't do this)
- [ ] OS notifications and tray icon
- [ ] Auto-update system via GitHub releases
- [ ] Local SQLite storage (no cloud needed)

**Week 11-12: Developer Experience**

- [ ] Blueprint file format (.atom files)
  - YAML-based (human-readable unlike n8n's JSON)
  - Git-friendly (mergeable)
  - Portable (share via GitHub gists)
- [ ] Web app deployment to Cloudflare Pages
  - Automatic builds from GitHub
  - Global CDN included
  - Preview deployments for PRs
- [ ] Visual debugging (better than n8n's console logs)
  - Step-through execution
  - Data inspection at each node
  - Performance profiling built-in

## 7. Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: Performance degrades with scale

- **Mitigation**: Streaming architecture from day one
- **Mitigation**: WebAssembly for compute-intensive tasks
- **Mitigation**: Profiling in CI/CD pipeline

**Risk**: AI costs spiral out of control

- **Mitigation**: Users provide their own API keys
- **Mitigation**: Local LLM options (Ollama)
- **Mitigation**: Caching and token optimization

### Market Risks

**Risk**: n8n adds our features

- **Mitigation**: Stay focused on simplicity (they can't remove features)
- **Mitigation**: Desktop-first advantage (they're web-first)
- **Mitigation**: Move faster (solo dev vs enterprise)

**Risk**: No user adoption

- **Mitigation**: Dogfood our own tool
- **Mitigation**: Focus on specific use cases
- **Mitigation**: Build in public for feedback

### Resource Risks

**Risk**: Burnout as solo developer

- **Mitigation**: Realistic timeline (1 year to 100 users)
- **Mitigation**: Automate everything possible
- **Mitigation**: Community contributors after Phase 1
- **Mitigation**: Say no to feature creep

## Key Differentiators Summary

### Where We Beat n8n

1. **Performance**: 10-30x faster through streaming and WebAssembly
2. **Simplicity**: 20 nodes vs 500+, focused on what matters
3. **Desktop-First**: Full system access, no deployment complexity
4. **AI-Native**: Built for LLMs from day one, not retrofitted
5. **Modern Stack**: Vite, React 18, Mantine (no legacy debt)
6. **Developer Experience**: < 1 minute to start, < 5 minutes to first workflow
7. **Resource Efficiency**: 5x less memory, runs on any machine
8. **File-Based**: Git-friendly, portable, no vendor lock-in

### Our Unfair Advantages

- **Zero Infrastructure Costs**: Everything runs on user's machine
- **No Legacy Burden**: Can make breaking changes freely
- **Solo Developer Speed**: No meetings, instant decisions
- **Learning Project**: Can experiment and pivot quickly
- **Community First**: Built in public with user feedback

## Next Actions (Immediate)

1. **Week 1**: Complete package restructuring to @atomiton namespace
2. **Week 2**: Integrate packages/core from previous repository
3. **Week 3**: Start Vite migration (highest technical debt)
4. **Week 4**: Begin Mantine migration for better components
5. **Week 5**: Build basic execution engine with streaming

---

**Remember**: We're not competing with n8n for enterprises. We're building something simpler, faster, and more accessible for individual creators and small teams. Every decision should optimize for simplicity and performance, not feature completeness.
