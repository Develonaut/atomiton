# Turbo Optimization Migration Guide

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

**Migration completed successfully on 2025-09-11**

This migration has been successfully implemented with significant performance improvements and workflow optimizations.

## Overview

This guide documents the completed migration to better leverage Turbo's capabilities in the Atomiton monorepo. The original setup had basic Turbo configuration but missed many optimization opportunities. This migration successfully implemented comprehensive improvements to build performance, caching, and developer experience.

## Pre-Migration State

### What We Had
- Basic Turbo tasks: `build`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `dev`
- Workspace dependency management with pnpm
- Complex 62-line `.lintstagedrc.js` with custom package detection
- Manual port killing and development server management
- 80+ lines of duplicated environment variables in turbo.json

### What Was Missing
- Comprehensive output caching configuration
- Format tasks in the Turbo pipeline
- Simplified lint-staged configuration
- Global dependencies for shared config invalidation
- Proper cache invalidation patterns

## Implemented Changes

### ✅ Enhanced turbo.json Configuration

**Implemented Successfully:**
- Added `globalEnv` and `globalDependencies` for shared config invalidation
- Added comprehensive `outputs` configuration for all tasks (build, lint, typecheck, format, test)
- Reduced environment variables from 80+ lines to 15 lines (removed duplicates)
- Added missing tasks: `format`, `format:check`, and `test`

**Key Improvements:**
```json
{
  "globalEnv": ["NODE_ENV", "CI", "VERCEL_ENV"],
  "globalDependencies": [".eslintrc.*", "tsconfig*.json", "*.config.*"],
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": ["dist/**", "build/**", ".next/**"],
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "format": {
      "outputs": [],
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

### ✅ Simplified Lint-Staged Configuration

**Replaced:** Complex 62-line `.lintstagedrc.js` with custom package detection and test orchestration

**With:** Clean 7-line configuration using Turbo's `--affected` flag:
```json
{
  "*": "turbo run lint typecheck format --affected --filter=...{HEAD~1}"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Fixed race conditions in sequential execution
- Eliminated custom package detection logic
- Uses Turbo's dependency graph for coordination
- Proper handling of affected packages

### ✅ Universal Format Script Addition

**Implemented:** Added `format` and `format:check` scripts to ALL 13 packages

**Package Types:**
- **Active packages**: Use Prettier for actual formatting
- **Config packages**: Use echo commands for non-applicable tasks

**Result:** Consistent script interface across entire monorepo

### ✅ Root Script Optimization

**Simplified:** Root `package.json` scripts to use Turbo consistently
- Removed complex `--filter` usage
- Standardized development workflows
- Leveraged Turbo's built-in dependency resolution

## Migration Steps (Original Plan vs Implementation)

### Phase 1: Enhanced Task Configuration

#### 1.1 Add Missing Task Outputs
**Goal**: Enable proper caching for all tasks

**Current Issue**: Most tasks lack `outputs` configuration, preventing Turbo from caching results effectively.

**Changes Needed**:
- Add `outputs` arrays to all tasks in `turbo.json`
- Include build artifacts, type declaration files, and test results
- Configure cache invalidation patterns

#### 1.2 Add Test Task
**Goal**: Integrate test execution into Turbo pipeline

**Current Issue**: Tests run independently without dependency awareness or caching.

**Changes Needed**:
- Add `test` task to `turbo.json`
- Configure test outputs and dependencies
- Set up proper test task dependencies (`^build`)

#### 1.3 Add Format Task
**Goal**: Include Prettier formatting in Turbo pipeline

**Current Issue**: Formatting runs outside Turbo, missing caching benefits.

**Changes Needed**:
- Add `format` and `format:check` tasks to `turbo.json`
- Configure appropriate file inputs and dependencies

### Phase 2: Lint-Staged Simplification

#### 2.1 Replace Custom Lint-Staged Logic
**Goal**: Simplify pre-commit hooks using Turbo's affected detection

**Current Issue**: Complex 60+ line `.lintstagedrc.js` with custom package detection and test orchestration.

**Changes Needed**:
- Replace with simple `turbo run lint test format --affected`
- Remove package-specific file grouping logic
- Leverage Turbo's dependency graph for coordination

#### 2.2 Update Husky Configuration
**Goal**: Streamline pre-commit hook execution

**Changes Needed**:
- Update `.husky/pre-commit` to use Turbo commands
- Remove dependency on lint-staged package
- Simplify hook logic

### Phase 3: Development Workflow Optimization

#### 3.1 Optimize Dev Scripts
**Goal**: Replace manual filtering with Turbo's dependency graph

**Current Issue**: Root `package.json` has complex dev scripts with manual `--filter` usage.

**Changes Needed**:
- Simplify dev commands using Turbo's built-in dependency resolution
- Remove custom port killing scripts in favor of Turbo task dependencies
- Create standardized dev workflows

#### 3.2 Add Global Dependencies
**Goal**: Ensure proper cache invalidation for shared configuration

**Changes Needed**:
- Add `globalDependencies` to `turbo.json` for shared config files
- Include ESLint configs, TypeScript configs, and other shared tools
- Ensure cache invalidation when shared configs change

### Phase 4: Advanced Turbo Features

#### 4.1 Remote Caching Setup
**Goal**: Enable team-wide cache sharing

**Changes Needed**:
- Configure Turbo remote cache (Vercel or custom)
- Set up authentication and team access
- Update CI/CD pipelines to leverage remote cache

#### 4.2 Pipeline Optimization
**Goal**: Maximize parallel execution and minimize unnecessary work

**Changes Needed**:
- Review and optimize task dependency chains
- Implement `--continue` flags where appropriate
- Configure proper task persistence settings
