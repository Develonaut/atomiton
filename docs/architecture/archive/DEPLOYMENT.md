# Deployment Strategy

**Status**: **NOT APPLICABLE** - System has 375+ TypeScript errors  
**Priority**: Fix compilation first, deploy later

## Current Reality

- ‚ùå Cannot deploy what doesn't compile
- ‚ùå No production builds possible
- ‚ùå Tests don't run
- ‚ùå Development environment barely works

## Future Deployment (After System Works)

### Phase 1: Local Development

- Fix TypeScript errors (375+)
- Get dev server running
- Enable basic testing

### Phase 2: Basic Deployment

- Docker containers for API
- Electron packaging for desktop
- Basic CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 3: Production Ready

- Auto-updates for Electron
- Monitoring and logging
- Security hardening
- Load balancing

## Don't Waste Time On

Until the system compiles:

- ‚ùå Kubernetes configurations
- ‚ùå Complex CI/CD pipelines
- ‚ùå Performance optimization
- ‚ùå Multi-region deployment

---

**Reality**: Can't deploy broken code. Fix compilation first.

üìÅ **Original Design**: See [archive/DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY_DESIGN.md](./archive/DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY_DESIGN.md) for the complete 912-line deployment strategy (for reference after fixing compilation).
