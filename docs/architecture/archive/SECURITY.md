# Security Architecture

**Status**: **NOT RELEVANT** - System doesn't compile  
**Priority**: Fix compilation first, security later

## Current Security State

- ‚ùå No authentication (system doesn't run)
- ‚ùå No authorization (can't execute nodes)
- ‚ùå No input validation (Zod is broken)
- ‚ùå No deployment (nothing to secure)

## Future Security (After System Works)

### Phase 1: Basic Security

- Input validation with Zod
- Basic authentication
- HTTPS only
- Environment variables for secrets

### Phase 2: Production Security

- JWT authentication
- Role-based access
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging

### Phase 3: Enterprise Security

- SSO integration
- Encryption at rest
- Compliance features
- Security scanning

## Don't Waste Time On

Until the system compiles:

- ‚ùå Complex authentication flows
- ‚ùå Advanced encryption
- ‚ùå Compliance frameworks
- ‚ùå Penetration testing

---

**Reality**: Can't secure what doesn't run. Fix TypeScript errors first.
