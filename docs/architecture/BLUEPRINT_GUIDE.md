## CRITICAL: Before Working on Blueprint Features

**ALWAYS read `/docs/ui/design/EDITOR_VISION.md` first** when working on:

- Blueprint Editor UI components (âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**)
- Node creation or modification (âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**)
- Visual workflow features (âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**)
- Node palette or connection logic (âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**)
- Blueprint execution or visualization

This document contains:

- Design specifications and color schemes (Dracula theme) âœ…
- Node structure and categories âœ…
- Interaction patterns and UX requirements âœ…
- Performance targets and success metrics

## Blueprint System Architecture

The Blueprint system is the core of the Atomiton platform, enabling visual workflow creation through a node-based editor.

### Core Components

1. **Blueprint Editor** - Visual workflow designer using React Flow
2. **Node Registry** - Catalog of available node types
3. **Execution Engine** - Runtime for executing Blueprint workflows
4. **Job System** - Queue and management for Blueprint executions

### System Components

**Visual Blueprint Editor Foundation**:

- React Flow visual editor with drag-and-drop functionality
- Node types across multiple categories
- Dracula theme consistently applied across all components
- Test coverage including E2E tests with Playwright
- Editor accessible at /blueprints route in client app

**Required Components**:

**Blueprint Execution Engine**

- Components: Job queue, node execution runtime, progress tracking
- Purpose: Core platform functionality for Blueprint execution

**Node Configuration System**

- Components: Property panels, validation, type checking
- Purpose: Node property editing and behavior customization

**Blueprint Persistence**

- Components: Blueprint serialization, file storage, version management
- Purpose: Save and load Blueprint functionality

**Connection Validation**

- Components: Type checking, validation rules, user feedback
- Purpose: Prevent invalid workflow creation

**Architectural Decisions**:

- Blueprint Editor maintained in `@atomiton/ui` package
- E2E testing through client app using Playwright
- Future extraction to `@atomiton/blueprint-editor` package as complexity grows

### Development Requirements

When working on Blueprint features, ensure:

- Visual consistency with Dracula theme
- Node categorization follows established color coding
- Performance meets target metrics from vision document
- Integration with existing data models

### Next Development Priorities

**Core Functionality Requirements**:

1. **Blueprint Execution Engine**
   - Components: Job queue system, node execution runtime, progress tracking
   - Purpose: Enable Blueprint execution beyond visual editing
   - Priority: Critical for platform functionality

2. **Node Configuration System**
   - Components: Property panels, validation, type checking
   - Purpose: Node customization and property editing
   - Priority: Essential for usability

3. **Save/Load Functionality**
   - Components: Blueprint serialization, file storage, version management
   - Purpose: Blueprint persistence and workflow management
   - Priority: Basic functionality requirement

4. **Security Architecture**
   - Components: Input validation, sandboxed execution, authentication
   - Purpose: Production security and vulnerability prevention
   - Priority: Required for production deployment

5. **Connection Validation**
   - Enable type checking between connected nodes
   - Prevent invalid workflow creation
   - Provide user feedback on connection errors

6. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful failure management across the system
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Recovery mechanisms
