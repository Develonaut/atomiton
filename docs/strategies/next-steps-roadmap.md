# Next Steps Roadmap - Atomiton Migration

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed

- **Phase 1 Vite Setup**: Vite configuration working alongside Next.js
- **CSS Compatibility Resolved**: Downgraded Tailwind CSS v4 ‚Üí v3.4.15
- **Parallel Development**: Both Next.js and Vite dev servers functional
- **Design System Preserved**: All styling and custom properties maintained

### üöß In Progress

- Next.js to Vite migration (Phase 1 of 5 complete)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Complete Vite Migration First (Recommended)

**Timeline: 5-7 days**

This approach completes the Next.js ‚Üí Vite migration before tackling the UI library change.

#### Advantages:

- ‚úÖ Immediate developer experience improvements (faster HMR)
- ‚úÖ Single focus area reduces complexity
- ‚úÖ Easier debugging with one variable changing
- ‚úÖ Can leverage Vite's superior build tools for later Mantine migration

#### Phase 2: Routing Migration (2 days)

1. Install React Router v6
2. Create route configuration mapping Next.js routes
3. Replace Next.js navigation hooks
4. Update Link components
5. Test all navigation paths

#### Phase 3: Component Migration (2 days)

1. Replace `next/image` with optimized image solution
2. Remove `next/link` dependencies
3. Update metadata handling
4. Remove all Next.js specific imports

#### Phase 4: Build System Cleanup (1 day)

1. Remove Next.js dependencies
2. Update Turborepo configuration
3. Clean up configuration files
4. Optimize build output

#### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization (1-2 days)

1. Complete test suite execution
2. Performance benchmarking
3. Bundle size optimization
4. Documentation updates

### Option B: Parallel UI Migration

**Timeline: 10-12 days**

Start Mantine migration while completing Vite migration.

#### Advantages:

- ‚úÖ Faster overall timeline if resources available
- ‚úÖ Can test Mantine components in Vite immediately

#### Disadvantages:

- ‚ùå Higher complexity with two migrations
- ‚ùå Harder to isolate issues
- ‚ùå Risk of conflicting changes

### Option C: Minimal Vite + Start Mantine

**Timeline: 8-10 days**

Get minimal Vite working (current state) and immediately start Mantine migration.

#### Advantages:

- ‚úÖ Avoids duplicate work on components
- ‚úÖ Direct path to final architecture

#### Disadvantages:

- ‚ùå Next.js remains partially in place longer
- ‚ùå More complex rollback scenarios

## Strategic Recommendation

### üéØ Recommended Approach: Option A

**Complete the Vite migration first, then tackle Mantine.**

### Reasoning:

1. **Foundation First**: Vite provides the modern build foundation that will make the Mantine migration smoother
2. **Clear Separation**: Each migration has distinct goals and can be validated independently
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Easier to rollback or debug issues with single-focus migrations
4. **Team Velocity**: Can maintain momentum with clear, achievable phases

### Immediate Action Items

#### This Week (Priority Order):

1. **Complete Vite Phase 2 - Routing** (2 days)
   - Install and configure React Router v6
   - Create route mapping from Next.js structure
   - Update all navigation components
   - Validate all routes work in both systems

2. **Complete Vite Phase 3 - Components** (2 days)
   - Replace Next.js specific components
   - Implement image optimization strategy
   - Update SEO/metadata handling
   - Ensure feature parity

3. **Vite Cutover** (1 day)
   - Remove Next.js completely
   - Update CI/CD pipelines
   - Update documentation
   - Team training on new setup

#### Next Week:

4. **Begin Mantine Migration Phase 1** (2 days)
   - Install Mantine alongside Tailwind
   - Set up theme configuration
   - Create component migration plan
   - Build first proof-of-concept component

5. **Mantine Component Migration** (3-5 days)
   - Migrate components by priority
   - Maintain visual regression tests
   - Progressive rollout strategy

## Success Metrics

### For Vite Migration:

- [ ] Dev server startup < 500ms
- [ ] HMR updates < 100ms
- [ ] Build time < 5 seconds
- [ ] Bundle size equal or smaller
- [ ] All routes functional
- [ ] All tests passing

### For Mantine Migration:

- [ ] Visual parity maintained
- [ ] No runtime errors
- [ ] Component API documented
- [ ] Theme system implemented
- [ ] Accessibility maintained
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Risk Mitigation

### Contingency Plans:

1. **If Vite routing proves complex**:
   - Keep Next.js routing temporarily
   - Use Vite for build only
   - Gradual route migration

2. **If Mantine theming difficult**:
   - Create hybrid approach
   - Use Mantine for new components only
   - Maintain Tailwind for existing

3. **If timeline slips**:
   - Prioritize Vite completion
   - Defer Mantine to next sprint
   - Keep parallel setup operational

## Dependencies & Blockers

### Current Dependencies:

- ‚úÖ CSS compatibility (RESOLVED with v3 downgrade)
- ‚è≥ React Router setup (Phase 2)
- ‚è≥ Image optimization strategy (Phase 3)

### Potential Blockers:

- Complex routing patterns in app
- Custom Next.js features discovered
- Performance regression risks

## Team Alignment

### Recommended Assignments:

- **Parker**: Lead Vite migration phases 2-5
- **Michael**: Architecture oversight and code reviews
- **Karen**: Quality assurance and testing
- **Barbara**: Documentation updates
- **Brian**: Test implementation and validation

## Conclusion

The path forward is clear with the CSS blocker resolved. Completing the Vite migration first provides the strongest foundation for subsequent improvements. The 5-7 day timeline for Vite completion is achievable and will immediately improve developer experience while setting up for the Mantine migration.

**Next Immediate Step**: Begin Phase 2 (Routing Migration) of the Vite migration strategy.
