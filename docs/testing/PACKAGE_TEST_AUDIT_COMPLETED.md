# Package Test Script Audit - COMPLETED

## Date: 2025-01-12

## Status: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT

## Summary

All 13 packages now implement the standardized test scripts as defined in PACKAGE_TEST_SCRIPTS.md.

## Standardization Achieved

### ✅ All Packages (13/13) Now Have:

1. `test` - Default test command (maps to test:unit)
2. `test:unit` - Unit tests (vitest run)
3. `test:smoke` - Critical path tests (< 5s for pre-commit)
4. `test:benchmark` - Performance benchmarks (vitest bench --run)
5. `test:e2e` - End-to-end tests (playwright or echo for libraries)
6. `test:all` - Complete test suite (runs all tests sequentially)
7. `test:watch` - Development mode (vitest watch)
8. `test:coverage` - Coverage reports (vitest run --coverage)

## Packages Updated

### Core Packages

- ✅ **@atomiton/core** - All scripts added
- ✅ **@atomiton/conductor** - All scripts added
- ✅ **@atomiton/store** - All scripts added
- ✅ **@atomiton/editor** - All scripts added
- ✅ **@atomiton/nodes** - All scripts added

### Supporting Libraries

- ✅ **@atomiton/di** - All scripts added
- ✅ **@atomiton/events** - All scripts added
- ✅ **@atomiton/hooks** - All scripts added, test:run renamed to test:unit
- ✅ **@atomiton/storage** - All scripts added
- ✅ **@atomiton/form** - Already compliant (reference implementation)

### UI Package

- ✅ **@atomiton/ui** - Standardized while preserving Playwright tests
  - Kept existing playwright commands
  - Added standardized naming alongside existing commands
  - test:e2e properly maps to playwright test

### Config Packages

- ✅ **@atomiton/eslint-config** - All scripts added (with no-op for tests)
- ✅ **@atomiton/typescript-config** - All scripts added (with no-op for tests)

## Git Hook Updates

### Pre-commit Hook (Enhanced)

Now includes:

1. Lint-staged for formatting and linting
2. Package smoke tests via Turbo
3. E2E smoke tests if they exist
4. Proper error messaging and exit codes

### Pre-push Hook (Simplified)

- Removed all checks (moved to pre-commit)
- Now just a pass-through with status message
- Ensures commits are fully validated before push

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Create smoke tests** for each package
   - Target: < 1 second per package
   - Focus on critical paths only
   - Use \*.smoke.test.ts naming convention

2. **Add benchmark baselines** for performance-critical code
   - Conductor: Blueprint execution speed
   - Core: State management operations
   - Store: Zustand performance
   - Events: Event emission throughput

3. **Update CI/CD pipelines**

   ```yaml
   # Example GitHub Actions update
   - name: Run unit tests
     run: pnpm turbo test:unit

   - name: Run smoke tests
     run: pnpm turbo test:smoke

   - name: Run benchmarks
     run: pnpm turbo test:benchmark
   ```

### Monitoring & Enforcement

1. **Pre-commit enforcement**: All commits now require passing smoke tests
2. **Turbo caching**: Leverage Turbo for parallel test execution
3. **Coverage tracking**: Monitor via test:coverage scripts
4. **Performance tracking**: Regular benchmark runs to catch regressions

## Compliance Metrics

| Metric                       | Before | After | Target  |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ----- | ------- |
| Packages with test:unit      | 1      | 13    | 13 ✅   |
| Packages with test:smoke     | 1      | 13    | 13 ✅   |
| Packages with test:benchmark | 1      | 13    | 13 ✅   |
| Packages with test:e2e       | 1      | 13    | 13 ✅   |
| Packages with test:all       | 1      | 13    | 13 ✅   |
| Overall compliance           | 7.7%   | 100%  | 100% ✅ |

## Sample Smoke Test Template

```typescript
// src/core.smoke.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { createEngine, executeBlueprint } from "./index.js";

describe("Package Smoke Tests", () => {
  it("exports required functions", () => {
    expect(createEngine).toBeDefined();
    expect(executeBlueprint).toBeDefined();
  });

  it("creates instance successfully", () => {
    const engine = createEngine();
    expect(engine).toBeDefined();
  });

  it("handles basic operation", () => {
    const result = executeBlueprint({ nodes: [] });
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

## Sample Benchmark Template

```typescript
// src/__benchmarks__/performance.bench.ts
import { bench, describe } from "vitest";
import { processBlueprint } from "../index.js";

describe("Performance Benchmarks", () => {
  bench("process small blueprint (10 nodes)", () => {
    processBlueprint(smallFixture);
  });

  bench("process large blueprint (1000 nodes)", () => {
    processBlueprint(largeFixture);
  });
});
```
