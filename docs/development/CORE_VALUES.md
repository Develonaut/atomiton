Our development philosophy centers on creating **performant, scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly** applications. These core values guide every architectural decision and implementation detail.

## üéØ **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

- **Component Reusability**: Create modular, reusable components that can be composed in multiple contexts
- **Shared Libraries**: Centralize common functionality in shared packages and utilities
- **Template Systems**: Use Blueprint templates and node libraries to eliminate repetitive workflow creation
- **Configuration Management**: Single source of truth for settings, themes, and system configuration

**Implementation Examples:**

- `WorkflowNode` base component with consistent port and status management
- Shared `ConfigurationSection` component for consistent form layouts
- Centralized theme system with consistent spacing, colors, and typography
- Blueprint templates that encode best practices and common patterns

## üîß **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**

- **Clear Interfaces**: Simple, intuitive APIs that are easy to understand and use
- **Focused Components**: Single-responsibility components that do one thing well
- **Minimal Configuration**: Smart defaults with optional customization
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Hide complexity behind simple interfaces, reveal advanced options when needed

**Implementation Examples:**

- Node configuration panels that auto-generate from schemas
- File-based storage with simple YAML/JSON formats
- One-click Blueprint execution with sensible defaults
- Visual editor that abstracts complex workflow logic into drag-drop simplicity

## üéØ **Single Responsibility for Nodes**

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: Each workflow node must do exactly ONE thing well. This is non-negotiable.

### Node Design Rules:

1. **One Input, One Output, One Purpose**
   - A node should have a single, clear transformation
   - If you need "and" to describe what a node does, split it

2. **Examples of GOOD Node Design:**
   - ‚úÖ **ParseCSVNode**: Reads CSV ‚Üí Returns parsed data
   - ‚úÖ **ValidateDataNode**: Takes data ‚Üí Returns validated data or errors
   - ‚úÖ **GenerateSKUNode**: Takes product data ‚Üí Returns data with SKUs
   - ‚úÖ **CreateDirectoryNode**: Takes path ‚Üí Creates directory
   - ‚úÖ **ConvertToWebPNode**: Takes image ‚Üí Returns WebP image
   - ‚úÖ **ResizeImageNode**: Takes image + dimensions ‚Üí Returns resized image

3. **Examples of BAD Node Design:**
   - ‚ùå **ProcessCSVAndGenerateSKUsNode**: Does two things
   - ‚ùå **RenderAndOptimizeImageNode**: Should be two nodes
   - ‚ùå **ValidateAndTransformDataNode**: Validation and transformation are separate
   - ‚ùå **CreateDirectoryAndCopyFilesNode**: Directory creation ‚â† file operations

### Why This Matters:

- **Reusability**: Single-purpose nodes can be used in many workflows
- **Testability**: One function = one set of tests
- **Debugging**: Clear where failures occur
- **Composability**: Small nodes combine into complex workflows
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one function don't affect others

### Pipeline Example:

Instead of one complex node, chain simple ones:

```
CSV File ‚Üí ParseCSVNode
         ‚Üí ValidateDataNode
         ‚Üí GenerateSKUNode
         ‚Üí CreateDirectoryNode
         ‚Üí Success
```

Each node can be swapped, reused, or modified independently.

## ‚úÖ **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

- **Component Testing**: Every UI component has comprehensive test coverage
- **Node Testing**: Individual workflow nodes are thoroughly tested in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Blueprint execution and system integration are validated
- **User Journey Testing**: End-to-end workflows are tested from user perspective

**Testing Strategy:**

- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions, components, and node implementations
- **Integration Tests**: Blueprint execution, data flow between nodes, platform integration
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows from Blueprint creation to job completion
- **Performance Tests**: Validate execution efficiency and resource usage under load

## üß© **Modularity**

- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between UI, business logic, and platform integration
- **Plugin System**: Extensible node registry that supports custom node development
- **Component Composition**: Small, focused components that combine to create complex interfaces
- **Service Isolation**: Independent services with well-defined interfaces and boundaries

**Modular Structure:**

```
packages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blueprint-engine/    # Core Blueprint system logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node-registry/       # Node type management and execution
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui-components/       # Reusable UI component library
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ platform-adapter/   # Cross-platform abstraction layer
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/             # Common types, utilities, and constants
```

## üîÄ **API Abstraction & Platform Agnosticism**

- **Unified API Layer**: Single interface for all platform-specific implementations
- **Environment Detection**: Automatic routing based on runtime environment (Web vs Electron)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Features degrade elegantly when platform capabilities are limited
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: API changes isolated from consuming components

**Implementation Strategy:**

- **UnifiedApiService**: Central service that routes calls to appropriate backend
  - Web environment ‚Üí HTTP API with WebSocket for real-time updates
  - Electron environment ‚Üí IPC communication with main process
  - Future platforms ‚Üí Additional adapters without changing consumer code

**Benefits:**

- **Flexibility**: Switch between platforms without code changes
- **Maintainability**: Platform-specific logic isolated in one place
- **Testability**: Mock different platforms easily in tests
- **Future-Proof**: Add new platforms (mobile, cloud) without breaking existing code

**Example Pattern:**

```typescript
// Consumer doesn't care about platform
const products = await unifiedApiService.getProducts();

// Internally routes to correct implementation:
// - electronApi.getProducts() in Electron
// - apiService.getProducts() in Web
```

This abstraction ensures that breaking changes in platform APIs don't ripple through the entire system, maintaining stability during iteration.

## üöÄ **Extensibility**

- **Open Architecture**: Easy to add new node types without modifying core system
- **Platform Flexibility**: Support both web and desktop with consistent experience
- **Integration Ready**: Clean APIs for external integrations and third-party extensions
- **Future-Proof Design**: Architecture that can grow with changing requirements

**Extensibility Features:**

- **Node Type Registration**: Dynamic loading of custom node implementations
- **Blueprint Templates**: Community-shareable workflow templates
- **Platform Adapters**: Support for additional platforms (mobile, cloud, etc.)
- **API Layers**: Extensible integration points for external services

## üé® **Design Excellence**

- **User-Centered Design**: Interfaces designed around user mental models and workflows

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript First**: Comprehensive type safety throughout the application
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Consistent code formatting and style enforcement
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation for all public APIs and complex logic
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory peer review process for all changes

### Architecture Patterns

- **Composition over Inheritance**: Favor composition patterns for flexibility
- **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling between components and services
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Decoupled communication using events and observers
- **Immutable Data**: Use immutable data structures to prevent unexpected mutations

### Performance Guidelines

- **Lazy Loading**: Load components and data on-demand
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of subscriptions, timers, and resources
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Use appropriate data structures and algorithms
- **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting and tree shaking for optimal bundle sizes

### Security Practices

- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs and external data
- **Secure Defaults**: Security-first configuration and implementation
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions and access rights
- **Regular Audits**: Security and dependency vulnerability audits

These values ensure that Atomiton remains maintainable, extensible, and user-friendly as it grows from a specialized 3D rendering tool into a comprehensive automation platform.
