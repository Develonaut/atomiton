# n8n Architecture Analysis

## Executive Summary

n8n is a sophisticated workflow automation platform built on a monorepo architecture using TypeScript, Vue.js, and a robust node-based system. This analysis provides actionable insights for Atomiton's architectural decisions based on n8n's implementation patterns.

## 1. Tech Stack Analysis

### Package Structure and Monorepo Setup

**Key Findings:**

- **Package Manager**: pnpm with workspace configuration
- **Build System**: Turborepo for orchestrating builds and caching
- **Monorepo Pattern**: Scoped packages under `@n8n/` namespace

```json
// Root package.json structure
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=22.16",
    "pnpm": "10.12.1"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "turbo build",
    "dev": "turbo dev --parallel",
    "test": "turbo test"
  }
}
```

**Package Organization:**

- `packages/core` - Core functionality and shared logic
- `packages/workflow` - Workflow engine and execution
- `packages/cli` - Application bootstrapping and API
- `packages/nodes-base` - Built-in node implementations
- `packages/@n8n/*` - Scoped internal packages (DI, config, permissions)

### The @n8n Namespace Pattern

**Public API Design:**

- Scoped packages provide clear boundaries between public and internal APIs
- `@n8n/di` - Custom dependency injection framework
- `@n8n/config` - Centralized configuration management
- `@n8n/backend-common` - Shared backend utilities
- `@n8n/permissions` - Authorization and access control

**Benefits:**

- Clear separation of concerns
- Prevents accidental imports of internal APIs
- Enables versioning of internal packages independently
- Provides namespace protection in npm registry

### Dependency Injection Patterns

**Implementation Details:**

- Custom DI package using TypeScript decorators
- Leverages `reflect-metadata` for runtime type reflection
- Lightweight alternative to heavy frameworks like NestJS

```typescript
// Implied pattern from dependencies
import "reflect-metadata";
// Decorator-based injection for services
```

### Build and Deployment Architecture

**Build Pipeline (Turbo):**

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    },
    "typecheck": {
      "dependsOn": ["^typecheck"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Features:**

- Incremental builds with dependency tracking
- Intelligent caching for unchanged packages
- Parallel task execution for development
- Environment-specific configurations

### Testing Strategies

**Multi-layered Testing Approach:**

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest for fast unit testing
- **Integration Tests**: Jest for broader testing scenarios
- **E2E Tests**: Cypress and Playwright for UI testing
- **Database Tests**: Support for multiple database engines

```json
// Testing configuration
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest run",
    "test:dev": "vitest",
    "test:e2e": "cypress run"
  }
}
```

## 2. Core Architecture Patterns

### Workflow Engine Design

**Core Components:**

- **Workflow Class**: Central orchestration of node execution
- **Expression Engine**: JavaScript-based expression evaluation
- **Data Transformation**: JMESPath and AST manipulation for data processing

**Key Dependencies in Workflow Package:**

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "ast-types": "^0.15.2",
    "esprima-next": "^6.0.0",
    "jmespath": "^0.16.0",
    "recast": "^0.23.9"
  }
}
```

### Node System Implementation

**Architecture:**

- **Node Base Classes**: Abstract classes for different node types
- **Credential Management**: Separate credential objects per node
- **Dynamic Loading**: Nodes discovered and loaded at runtime
- **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript interfaces for node definitions

**Directory Structure:**

```
packages/nodes-base/
├── credentials/     # Authentication configurations
├── nodes/          # Node implementations
├── types/          # TypeScript interfaces
└── utils/          # Shared utilities
```

### Plugin/Extension Architecture

**Extension Points:**

- Custom nodes can be added without modifying core
- Credential types are extensible
- Workflow functions can be extended via expressions
- Community nodes supported through npm packages

### State Management Approach

**Backend State:**

- TypeORM for database persistence
- Redis support for queue management
- In-memory caching for performance

**Frontend State:**

- Vue 3 composition API
- Pinia for state management (likely, based on Vue 3 ecosystem)
- Reactive data flow for real-time updates

### Event-Driven Patterns

**Key Patterns:**

- Webhook support for external triggers
- Event emitters for internal communication
- Queue-based execution for scalability
- WebSocket for real-time UI updates
