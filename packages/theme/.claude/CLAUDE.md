# Theme Package - Claude Instructions

This is the **@atomiton/theme** package - the single source of truth for all visual styling.

## Package Status

⚠️ **Currently empty - waiting for migration**

This package will contain the Brainwave 2.0 theme configuration after the Tailwind → Mantine migration is complete.

## What Will Be Here

- Brainwave 2.0 color palette
- Mantine theme configuration
- Brainwave 2.0 visual effects
- Gradient definitions
- Typography scales
- Animation timings

## Documentation

See [/docs/domains/theme/](../../../docs/domains/theme/) for:

- Brainwave 2.0 aesthetic vision
- Color palette documentation
- Implementation roadmap
- Architecture patterns

## Current Priority

HIGH - Part of UI migration:

1. Complete Vite migration first
2. Migrate from Tailwind to Mantine
3. Apply Brainwave 2.0 theme
4. Extract to this package

## Key Decisions

- Brainwave 2.0 aesthetic (NOT Dracula)
- Mantine-based theming
- Single source of truth for all packages
- Beautiful is the differentiator
