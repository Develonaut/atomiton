### Modifications

The original code has been adapted for use in the Atomiton project with the following changes:

1. Simplified to remove n8n-specific features
2. Added additional convenience methods (`clear()`, `getRegisteredServices()`)
3. Added `@Injectable` alias for compatibility
4. Enhanced JSDoc documentation with examples
5. Adjusted error messages and branding
6. Removed n8n-specific build tooling references

### Why We Chose This Implementation

n8n's DI implementation provides:

- A lightweight, maintainable alternative to TypeDI
- Built-in circular dependency detection
- Support for factory functions
- Clean, understandable codebase
- Proven in production use

### License Compliance
