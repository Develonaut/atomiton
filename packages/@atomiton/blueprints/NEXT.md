# Next Work Queue - @atomiton/blueprints

## Priority 1 - Critical

### Node Registry Integration

Fix the module resolution issues preventing direct integration with @atomiton/nodes:

- [ ] Resolve ES module import path extensions in @atomiton/nodes
- [ ] Add missing `getAvailableTypes()` method to NodesAPI
- [ ] Implement proper nodes registry integration
- [ ] Remove fallback node type list

### Enhanced Validation

- [ ] Add blueprint dependency validation (blueprints that reference other blueprints)
- [ ] Implement variable type validation
- [ ] Add port compatibility checking between connected nodes
- [ ] Validate blueprint execution flow integrity

## Priority 2 - Important

### Advanced Features

- [ ] Blueprint versioning and migration system
- [ ] Blueprint templates and scaffolding
- [ ] Blueprint composition and inheritance
- [ ] Blueprint performance optimization analysis

### Integration Improvements

- [ ] Add @atomiton/store integration for blueprint state management
- [ ] Implement blueprint caching layer
- [ ] Add blueprint change tracking and diff utilities
- [ ] Create blueprint import/export utilities

### Developer Experience

- [ ] Add blueprint CLI tools
- [ ] Create VS Code extension for blueprint editing
- [ ] Add blueprint debugging utilities
- [ ] Implement blueprint visualization tools

## Priority 3 - Nice to Have

### Performance

- [ ] Large blueprint handling optimization
- [ ] Streaming validation for massive blueprints
- [ ] Blueprint compilation/preprocessing
- [ ] Memory usage optimization

### Advanced Validation

- [ ] Blueprint security validation
- [ ] Resource usage estimation
- [ ] Blueprint complexity analysis
- [ ] Circular dependency detection

### Ecosystem Integration

- [ ] Blueprint marketplace integration
- [ ] Blueprint sharing and collaboration features
- [ ] Blueprint version control integration
- [ ] Blueprint analytics and usage tracking

## Ideas Backlog

- Blueprint AI assistant for optimization suggestions
- Real-time collaborative blueprint editing
- Blueprint testing framework
- Blueprint documentation generation
- Visual blueprint diff tool
- Blueprint performance profiler
