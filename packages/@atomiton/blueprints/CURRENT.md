# Current Work - @atomiton/blueprints

## Sprint: September 12, 2025

### 🚀 Active Tasks

- [ ] Investigate @atomiton/nodes module resolution issues
- [ ] Resolve direct dependency integration with nodes registry

### 🔄 In Review

- ✅ Package implementation and validation - COMPLETED
- ✅ Documentation review by Barbara - COMPLETED
- ✅ Final validation by Karen - COMPLETED

### ⚠️ Blocked

- [ ] Direct @atomiton/nodes integration due to issues in @atomiton/nodes package:
  - ES module import path extensions required (.js) in nodes/src/index.ts
  - Missing methods in NodesAPI (getAvailableTypes)
  - **Dependency removed** from package.json to prevent build failures

## Notes

The @atomiton/blueprints package is functionally complete and production-ready, but currently uses a fallback approach for node type validation instead of direct integration with @atomiton/nodes due to module resolution issues in the nodes package.

**Current Status**: The package works correctly with a hardcoded list of common node types. Future improvement would integrate directly with the nodes registry once the module resolution issues are resolved.
