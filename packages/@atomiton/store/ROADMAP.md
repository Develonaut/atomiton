# Roadmap - Store Package

## Vision

Build a powerful, type-safe state management system that handles all aspects of
Atomiton's complex application state, from Blueprint workflows to real-time
collaboration, with exceptional developer experience and performance.

## Q4 2025 - Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

### Core Store System (SIMPLIFIED & DELIVERED)

- ✅ Zustand and Immer integration
- ✅ TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Testing infrastructure
- ✅ **Simplified API**: Single `createStore()` function (reduced from 473 to
  111 lines)
- ✅ **Essential Features**: Removed StoreAPI singleton, createAction,
  createSelector utilities
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Functional approach with optional persistence

### Developer Experience ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ **Simplified store creation**: One function for all use cases
- ✅ **React integration**: Built-in useStore and shallow exports
- ✅ **Enhanced documentation**: Comprehensive README with examples
- ✅ **Migration guidance**: Clear before/after examples for API changes
