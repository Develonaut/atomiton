- [ ] Create computed/derived state utilities
- [ ] Add state change batching and debouncing

## Priority 3: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement selective subscriptions and fine-grained updates
- [ ] Add memoization utilities for expensive computations
- [ ] Create store performance monitoring tools
- [ ] Add lazy loading for large state objects

## Priority 4: Integration Features
