# @atomiton/utils Roadmap

## Vision

The @atomiton/utils package serves as the foundational utility library for the entire Atomiton ecosystem, providing consistent, well-tested, and performant utility functions that all other packages can rely on.

## Strategic Goals

1. **Consistency** - Provide a single source of truth for common operations
2. **Performance** - Optimize for speed and memory efficiency
3. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript coverage with strict typing
4. **Tree Shaking** - Support optimal bundle sizes through proper exports
5. **Zero Dependencies** - Minimize external dependencies for reliability

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current - v0.1.0) âœ…

- [x] Core utility functions (string, object, array, async, validation)
- [x] Basic test coverage (unit, smoke, benchmark)
- [x] Package structure and build configuration
- [x] Integration with monorepo

## Phase 2: Enhancement (v0.2.0)

- [ ] Date/time utilities
  - Date formatting and parsing
  - Timezone handling
  - Duration calculations
  - Relative time helpers
- [ ] Number utilities
  - Formatting (currency, percentage, etc.)
  - Math operations
  - Random number generation
  - Statistical functions
- [ ] Cryptography utilities
  - Hashing (SHA, MD5)
  - Encoding/decoding (base64, hex)
  - UUID generation
  - Simple encryption helpers

## Phase 3: Specialization (v0.3.0)

- [ ] Browser utilities
  - DOM manipulation
  - Event handling
  - Storage management
  - Network utilities
- [ ] Node.js utilities
  - File system helpers
  - Process management
  - Stream utilities
  - CLI helpers
- [ ] React utilities
  - Hook helpers
  - Component utilities
  - State management helpers

## Phase 4: Optimization (v0.4.0)

- [ ] Performance improvements
  - Memoization strategies
  - Lazy loading
  - Web Workers support
- [ ] Bundle optimization
  - Sub-package exports
  - Dynamic imports
  - Conditional exports
- [ ] Advanced testing
  - Property-based testing
  - Mutation testing
  - Performance regression testing

## Phase 5: Ecosystem (v1.0.0)

- [ ] Plugin system
  - Extensible architecture
  - Custom utility registration
  - Third-party integrations
- [ ] Documentation
  - Interactive examples
  - Performance comparisons
  - Migration guides
- [ ] Tooling
  - VSCode extension
  - ESLint plugin
  - Code generation tools

## Design Principles

### 1. API Design

- Consistent naming conventions
- Predictable behavior
- Sensible defaults
- Clear error messages

### 2. Performance

- Optimize for common cases
- Avoid unnecessary allocations
- Use native methods when possible
- Benchmark critical paths

### 3. Maintainability

- Small, focused functions
- Comprehensive tests
- Clear documentation
- Regular dependency updates

### 4. Compatibility

- Support modern environments
- Graceful degradation
- Polyfills when necessary
- Clear browser/Node requirements

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Used by all Atomiton packages
- **Performance**: <5ms for 95% of operations
- **Size**: <50KB minified + gzipped for full package
- **Quality**: >90% test coverage, 0 critical bugs
- **Developer Experience**: <1min to find and use any utility

## Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies

- TypeScript for type safety
- Vitest for testing
- Vite for building

### Risks

- **Scope Creep**: Growing too large and becoming unmaintainable
  - Mitigation: Strict inclusion criteria, regular reviews
- **Performance Regression**: New features slowing down existing ones
  - Mitigation: Continuous benchmarking, performance budgets
- **Breaking Changes**: Updates breaking dependent packages
  - Mitigation: Semantic versioning, deprecation warnings

## Future Considerations

- **Wasm Integration**: Performance-critical operations in WebAssembly
- **AI-Assisted**: GPT-powered code generation and optimization
- **Cross-Platform**: React Native and Electron specific utilities
- **Internationalization**: Locale-aware string and number operations
- **Accessibility**: A11y-focused DOM utilities
