# Current Work - @atomiton/form

## Sprint: September 10, 2025

### ✅ Core Implementation - COMPLETE

**Completed September 10, 2025:**

- ✅ **Zustand-based form store** - State management integration with @atomiton/store
- ✅ **Zod validation system** - Schema-first validation with TypeScript inference
- ✅ **Field components** - TextField, NumberField, RadioField, SelectField
- ✅ **Form context** - React context for state distribution
- ✅ **Testing suite** - Comprehensive tests including integration and performance
- ✅ **Build configuration** - TypeScript compilation and development tools

### 🔄 Current Status: Ready for Review

**Package State:**

- **Core Architecture**: ✅ Complete
- **Field Components**: ✅ Implemented and tested
- **State Management**: ✅ Zustand integration working
- **Validation**: ✅ Zod schemas functional
- **Testing**: ⚠️ Some test failures exist
- **Documentation**: ✅ Progress tracking added

### ⚠️ Known Issues

**Test Failures:**

- [ ] Some integration tests failing - needs investigation
- [ ] Performance test edge cases - memory optimization needed
- [ ] Accessibility test adjustments required

**Not Critical for Initial Use:**

- [ ] Advanced field types (date, file upload)
- [ ] Custom validation error messages
- [ ] Form builder UI components

### 🔄 In Review

- Waiting for user review of core implementation
- Test failure resolution pending investigation

### 📋 Ready for Next Phase

Once current issues are resolved:

- Enhanced styling with Brainwave 2.0 integration
- Additional field types based on application needs
- Integration with node system for dynamic forms

## Package Status

**State**: 🟡 Ready for Review
**Core Functionality**: ✅ Complete
**Test Coverage**: ⚠️ Needs attention
**Documentation**: ✅ Updated

## Notes

The package has solid core functionality with Zustand state management and Zod validation. The architecture follows Atomiton patterns and integrates well with the existing store package. Some test failures need resolution, but the core implementation is ready for use in applications.

The focus has been on creating a practical form system for Atomiton's specific needs rather than a generic form library. All essential field types are implemented with consistent APIs and proper validation.
