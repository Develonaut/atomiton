   - [ ] Data transformation workflows

## What We're NOT Doing

- ‚ùå Building a generic form library for external use
- ‚ùå Supporting every possible field type immediately
- ‚ùå Complex wysiwyg editors (use dedicated packages)
- ‚ùå Highly specialized business logic fields
- ‚ùå Non-React framework support

## Success Metrics

### Technical Goals

- **Test Coverage**: 100% passing tests with good coverage
- **Performance**: < 100ms form rendering for typical forms
- **Bundle Size**: < 25KB for core form functionality
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all fields

### User Experience Goals

- **Developer Velocity**: Forms built 3x faster than custom implementation
- **Consistency**: All forms follow same patterns and styling
- **Maintainability**: 70% reduction in form-related bugs
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Atomiton components
