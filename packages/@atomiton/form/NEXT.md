# Next Steps - @atomiton/form

## Immediate Priorities (Next 2 Weeks)

### ðŸŽ¯ Primary Focus: API Stability & Documentation

The form package is currently in a stable state and actively used by the editor. Focus is on maintaining compatibility while supporting new use cases.

## Upcoming Enhancements

### Short-term (Next Month)

#### Advanced Field Types

- [ ] **Array Field Support**: Dynamic array field management with add/remove controls
- [ ] **Object Field Support**: Nested object editing with collapsible sections
- [ ] **Conditional Fields**: Fields that show/hide based on other field values
- [ ] **Field Validation**: Advanced validation rules beyond basic Zod schemas

#### Performance Optimizations

- [ ] **Memoization**: Optimize field generation for large schemas
- [ ] **Lazy Validation**: Defer validation until field interaction
- [ ] **Bundle Splitting**: Separate advanced features to reduce core bundle size

### Medium-term (Next Quarter)

#### Advanced Form Features

- [ ] **Form Wizard Support**: Multi-step form progression
- [ ] **Auto-save**: Automatic form state persistence
- [ ] **Field Grouping**: Visual grouping and collapsible sections
- [ ] **Custom Validators**: Plugin system for custom validation logic

#### Developer Experience

- [ ] **Form Builder**: Visual form designer for rapid prototyping
- [ ] **Schema Generator**: Tool to generate Zod schemas from JSON
- [ ] **Debug Tools**: Form state inspection and validation debugging
- [ ] **Storybook Integration**: Component documentation and playground

## Potential Enhancements (Awaiting Requirements)

### Advanced Integration

- [ ] **State Management**: Integration with Zustand/Redux for global form state
- [ ] **Animation Support**: Form transition animations and micro-interactions
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Enhanced ARIA support and keyboard navigation
- [ ] **Internationalization**: Multi-language form labels and validation messages

### Enterprise Features

- [ ] **Field Security**: Permission-based field visibility and editing
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: Track form changes and user interactions
- [ ] **Schema Versioning**: Backward compatibility for schema evolution
- [ ] **Integration APIs**: Connect with external validation services

## Dependencies & Blockers

### Current Dependencies

- **Editor Development**: Form package evolution follows editor requirements
- **Node System Changes**: New node types may require form enhancements
- **UI Component Updates**: Changes in @atomiton/ui may require adaptation

### Potential Blockers

- **React Hook Form Updates**: Major version changes may require migration
- **Zod Schema Changes**: Breaking changes in validation logic
- **Performance Requirements**: Large form performance may need optimization

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets

- **Form Generation**: < 5ms for schemas with 50+ fields
- **Validation Speed**: < 10ms for complex validation rules
- **Bundle Size**: Keep core bundle under 15KB gzipped
- **Memory Usage**: No memory leaks in dynamic form scenarios

### Developer Experience Goals

- **API Stability**: Zero breaking changes without major version bump
- **Documentation**: Complete API reference with interactive examples
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for common integration issues
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript coverage with accurate type inference

## Research Areas

### Form State Management

Investigate advanced form state patterns:

- Form state synchronization across components
- Optimistic updates and conflict resolution
- Real-time collaborative form editing

### Schema Evolution

Research schema migration strategies:

- Backward compatibility for form data
- Schema transformation pipelines
- Version detection and migration

### Performance Optimization

Explore performance improvements:

- Virtual scrolling for large forms
- Incremental validation strategies
- Web Workers for complex validation

## Integration Roadmap

### Editor Package Integration

- **Phase 1**: Support current node configuration needs
- **Phase 2**: Advanced property panel features (arrays, objects)
- **Phase 3**: Dynamic schema generation for custom nodes

### Node System Integration

- **Phase 1**: Maintain compatibility with existing node fields
- **Phase 2**: Support new node types and validation patterns
- **Phase 3**: Enable custom validation logic per node type

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Maintain 95%+ coverage for all new features
- **Integration Tests**: Test with real editor and node scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark all new features
- **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure WCAG compliance

### Documentation Requirements

- **API Documentation**: Keep README current with all features
- **Examples**: Provide working examples for all use cases
- **Migration Guides**: Document any breaking changes
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines for optimal form design
