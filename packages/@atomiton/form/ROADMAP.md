# Form Management Roadmap

## Vision

Build a TypeScript-first form management system that integrates seamlessly with Zustand state management and the @atomiton/ui component library. Focus on developer experience, type safety, and performance while supporting complex form patterns needed for the Atomiton platform.

## Current State (v0.1.0)

We have a basic package structure with foundational hooks and validation utilities. The package integrates with Zustand for state management and supports multiple validation libraries (Zod, Yup, Joi) with a preference for Zod.

## Phase 1: Foundation (✅ COMPLETE)

**Completed**: September 11, 2025

### Achieved

- ✅ Package structure and TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Core dependencies and build setup
- ✅ Basic hooks (useField, useFormMode)
- ✅ Zustand store integration
- ✅ Validation utility helpers
- ✅ Test setup and configuration

## Phase 2: Core Form Features (🚧 IN PROGRESS)

**Timeline**: September 2025  
**Goal**: Complete core form management functionality

### Key Features

- Form validation with comprehensive Zod integration
- Field state management (dirty, touched, error states)
- Async form submission with loading states
- Cross-field validation and dependencies
- Error handling and display patterns

### Hook Enhancements

- Enhanced useField with complete state management
- useForm hook for full form lifecycle
- useValidation for centralized validation logic
- Performance optimized re-rendering

## Phase 3: Form Components & Patterns (Q4 2025)

**Goal**: Reusable components and common form patterns

### Component Library Integration

- FormField wrapper with consistent styling
- FormSection for grouped fields
- SubmitButton with loading and disabled states
- Error display components

### Common Patterns

- Multi-step form wizard
- Dynamic field arrays
- Conditional field rendering
- Auto-save functionality
- Form serialization/deserialization

## Phase 4: Advanced Form Management (Q1 2026)

**Goal**: Advanced features for complex applications

### Advanced Features

- Schema-driven form generation
- Real-time validation feedback
- Form state persistence
- Undo/redo functionality
- Field dependency management

### Performance Optimizations

- Field-level subscriptions
- Minimal re-render patterns
- Lazy validation strategies
- Virtual scrolling for large forms

## Phase 5: Blueprint Editor Integration (Q2 2026)

**Goal**: Specialized forms for Blueprint editor

### Editor-Specific Forms

- Node property panels
- Dynamic configuration forms
- Workflow step configuration
- Connection parameter forms
- Bulk editing capabilities

### Real-time Collaboration

- Concurrent form editing
- Conflict resolution
- Live validation updates
- Form state synchronization

## Long-term Vision (2026 and Beyond)

### Potential Features

- Visual form builder integration
- AI-powered form optimization
- Advanced accessibility features
- Form analytics and insights
- Custom validation rule builder

## Success Metrics

### Technical Goals

- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript coverage
- **Performance**: < 5ms validation time for complex forms
- **Bundle Size**: < 20KB core functionality
- **Test Coverage**: 95%+ coverage

### Developer Experience Goals

- **Form Setup Time**: < 5 minutes for complex forms
- **Validation Errors**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Documentation**: Complete API documentation
- **Integration**: Seamless with @atomiton/ui components

## Design Principles

1. **Type Safety First** - Comprehensive TypeScript support
2. **Performance Focused** - Minimal re-renders and fast validation
3. **Developer Experience** - Clear, predictable APIs
4. **Flexible Integration** - Works with any UI library
5. **Validation Agnostic** - Support multiple validation approaches

## Integration Strategy

### With @atomiton/store

- Form state managed through Zustand
- Integration with application state
- Persistent form data across sessions

### With @atomiton/ui

- Consistent styling and theming
- Accessibility compliance
- Error display standardization

### With @atomiton/hooks

- Shared utility hooks
- Event handling patterns
- Performance optimizations

## Not in Scope

- ❌ Visual form builder UI (separate package)
- ❌ Form rendering engine (use with @atomiton/ui)
- ❌ Backend integration (API layer responsibility)
- ❌ Form analytics (separate concern)
