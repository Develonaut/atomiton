# Form Package Roadmap

## Vision

Build a comprehensive, Zustand-based form system that integrates seamlessly with Atomiton's Blueprint workflow platform. This package will provide type-safe, schema-driven forms with excellent developer experience while supporting the dynamic, node-based architecture of the Atomiton ecosystem.

## Current State (v0.1.0)

We have established the core form architecture with Zustand state management, Zod validation, and essential field components. The foundation is solid with comprehensive testing, but some test failures need resolution before full deployment.

## Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Completed**: September 10, 2025

### Achieved

- ‚úÖ Zustand-based form store with @atomiton/store integration
- ‚úÖ Zod schema validation with TypeScript inference
- ‚úÖ Core field components (Text, Number, Radio, Select)
- ‚úÖ React context for form state distribution
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Build system and development tools

## Phase 2: Bug Fixes and Optimization (üöß IN PROGRESS)

**Timeline**: September 2025  
**Goal**: Resolve test failures and stabilize for production use

### Critical Tasks

- Fix integration test failures and performance edge cases
- Optimize memory usage in large forms
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Enhance accessibility compliance

## Phase 3: Enhanced UI and Styling (Q4 2025)

**Goal**: Clean, customizable form components with shadcn-like primitives

### Visual Enhancements

- CSS variable-based theming system
- Dark mode support across all components
- Animation and transition improvements
- Consistent hover, focus, and error states

### Layout Components

- FormRow for horizontal layouts
- FieldGroup for related field organization
- FormSection for logical form divisions
- Responsive form layouts

## Phase 4: UI Framework Agnostic Architecture (Q1 2026)

**Goal**: Make the form library usable with any UI framework

### Core Separation

- Extract validation and state management to framework-agnostic core
- Create adapters for React, Vue, Solid, Svelte
- Vanilla JS API for direct usage
- Web Components wrapper for universal compatibility

### Architecture Refactor

- Separate `@atomiton/form-core` (no React dependencies)
- `@atomiton/form-react` adapter with hooks
- `@atomiton/form-vue` adapter with composables
- `@atomiton/form-solid` adapter with stores

### Benefits

- Wider adoption potential
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier testing without framework
- Reduced bundle size for core functionality

## Phase 5: Extended Field Library (Q2 2026)

**Goal**: Comprehensive field types for application needs

### Date and Time Components

- DateField with calendar picker
- TimeField with time selection
- DateTimeField combination
- DateRangeField for periods

### File and Media Components

- FileField for uploads with progress
- ImageField with preview functionality
- MultiFileField for batch uploads
- DragDropField for intuitive file handling

### Rich Input Components

- TextareaField for multi-line content
- PasswordField with visibility controls
- SearchField with autocomplete
- TagField for tag creation/selection

### Advanced Selection Components

- CheckboxField and CheckboxGroup
- ToggleField (switch-style boolean)
- MultiSelectField for multiple options
- ComboboxField (searchable select)

## Phase 6: Dynamic Forms and Logic (Q3 2026)

**Goal**: Support for complex, conditional form workflows

### Conditional Logic

- Field visibility based on other field values
- Dynamic validation rules
- Progressive form disclosure
- Field dependency management

### Array and Object Handling

- ArrayField for dynamic lists
- ObjectField for nested sections
- Repeater fields with add/remove
- Deep validation for nested structures

### Form Builder Interface

- Visual form designer
- Drag-and-drop field palette
- Property panels for configuration
- Real-time preview and testing

## Phase 7: Blueprint Integration (Q4 2026)

**Goal**: Deep integration with Atomiton's node-based workflow system

### Form Nodes

- FormNode for data collection workflows
- ValidationNode for schema processing
- FieldNode for individual field logic
- SubmissionNode for data handling

### Workflow Integration

- Form data as node inputs/outputs
- Validation results in node pipelines
- Error propagation through workflows
- Form state persistence in blueprints

### Dynamic Generation

- Node-driven form creation
- Runtime field configuration
- Conditional logic via workflow nodes
- Data transformation pipelines

## Phase 8: Advanced Features (2027)

**Goal**: Enterprise-grade form capabilities

### Performance Optimization

- Virtual scrolling for large forms
- Lazy validation strategies
- Field-level memoization
- Bundle size optimization (target < 25KB core)

### Accessibility Excellence

- Screen reader optimization
- Keyboard navigation enhancements
- High contrast mode support
- WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance

### Developer Experience

- Form debugging tools
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Visual schema editor
- Auto-generated TypeScript types

## Long-term Vision (2027 and Beyond)

### AI-Powered Forms

- Intelligent field suggestions
- Auto-completion based on context
- Form validation via ML models
- Natural language form generation

### Advanced Integrations

- Real-time collaboration on forms
- Version control for form schemas
- A/B testing for form layouts
- Analytics and conversion tracking

## Success Metrics

### Technical Goals

- **Performance**: < 100ms render time for typical forms
- **Bundle Size**: < 25KB for core functionality
- **Test Coverage**: > 95% with all tests passing
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum

### User Experience Goals

- **Developer Velocity**: 3x faster form development
- **Consistency**: Unified form patterns across Atomiton
- **Maintainability**: 70% reduction in form-related bugs
- **Integration**: Seamless Blueprint workflow integration

## Design Principles

1. **Schema-First**: Zod schemas drive validation and TypeScript types
2. **Performance Conscious**: Optimized for large, complex forms
3. **Accessibility First**: Inclusive design from the ground up
4. **Developer Experience**: Clear APIs with excellent TypeScript support
5. **Integration Ready**: Built for Atomiton's ecosystem from day one

## Component Target Architecture

### Current (4 core components)

- TextField, NumberField, RadioField, SelectField

### Phase 4 Target (15-20 components)

- 8-10 input field types
- 3-4 layout components
- 2-3 specialized components
- 2-3 utility components

### Long-term Target (25-30 components)

- Comprehensive field library
- Advanced layout systems
- Specialized workflow components
- AI-enhanced form builders

## What We're NOT Building

- ‚ùå Generic form library for external use (initially)
- ‚ùå WYSIWYG rich text editors (use dedicated packages)
- ‚ùå Complex charting or visualization fields
- ‚ùå Non-React framework support
- ‚ùå Backward compatibility with legacy browsers
