## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm (managed via Turborepo)
- This package requires the `@atomiton/theme` package to be built first

### Installation

From the project root:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
pnpm install

# Build theme dependency (required)
pnpm --filter @atomiton/theme build
```

### Development

```bash
# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Start with theme hot-reloading (recommended)
pnpm dev:with-theme
```

Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) to view the component showcase.

## Component Development

### Adding New Components

1. Create component directory in `/components/`
2. Implement component with TypeScript and Tailwind
3. Create showcase page in `/templates/`
4. Add route to `src/App.tsx`
5. Update visual regression tests

### Design System Integration

Components automatically inherit from the Atomiton theme via:

- **Theme Provider**: `components/ThemeProvider` wraps the entire app
- **Tailwind Config**: Uses `@atomiton/theme` for consistent design tokens
- **CSS Variables**: Theme-aware custom properties for colors, spacing, typography

### Component Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all components
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Implement responsive design (desktop-first)
- Include proper accessibility attributes
- Document props with JSDoc comments

## Testing

### Visual Regression Testing

The package uses Playwright for comprehensive visual regression testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Update screenshots (after intentional changes)
pnpm test --update-snapshots

# Run specific test
pnpm test baseline-buttons
```

Test files are located in `/tests/` and baseline screenshots in `/screenshots/`.

### Test Structure

Each component page has corresponding Playwright tests that:

- Navigate to the component page
- Take full-page screenshots
- Compare against baseline images
- Detect visual regressions automatically

## Integration with Atomiton

This UI package integrates with the larger Atomiton ecosystem:

- **Theme Package**: `@atomiton/theme` provides design tokens and Tailwind configuration
- **Core Package**: Components will be consumed by `@atomiton/core` Blueprint engine
- **Client App**: Final application in `apps/client` uses these components
- **Desktop App**: `packages/electron` packages everything as a desktop application

## Desktop-First Considerations

This UI library is designed specifically for desktop applications:

- **Fixed Viewports**: Optimized for standard desktop resolutions
- **Mouse Interactions**: Hover states, right-click menus, drag-and-drop
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility support
- **Desktop Patterns**: Native-feeling UI patterns and interactions
- **Performance**: Optimized for desktop rendering and interactions

## Monorepo Development

This package is part of the Atomiton Turborepo monorepo:

```bash
# From project root, run UI commands
pnpm --filter ui dev
pnpm --filter ui build
pnpm --filter ui test

# Run with workspace dependencies
pnpm --filter ui... dev  # Includes dependencies
```

## Contributing

1. Follow the established component patterns
2. Maintain visual regression tests
3. Update documentation for new components
4. Ensure TypeScript compliance
5. Test in desktop context

## Atomiton Design System

The components implement the complete Atomiton design system including:

- **Typography**: Responsive type scale with system fonts
- **Colors**: Semantic color system with dark/light theme support
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing scale based on 4px grid
- **Shadows**: Layered shadow system for depth perception
- **Interactions**: Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- **Icons**: Comprehensive icon system integrated with components

For detailed design specifications, see the `@atomiton/theme` package documentation.
