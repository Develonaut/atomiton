# Roadmap - Events Package

## Vision

Create a comprehensive, type-safe event system that serves as the backbone for communication across the Atomiton platform, enabling real-time collaboration, workflow orchestration, and reactive user interfaces.

## Q4 2025 - Foundation

### Core Event System (CURRENT)

- ✅ Type-safe EventEmitter implementation
- ✅ Subscription and cleanup management
- ✅ Testing infrastructure
- [ ] Event validation and error handling
- [ ] Performance optimization and monitoring

### IPC Support (HIGH PRIORITY - Q1 2025)

**Required by @atomiton/conductor package**

- [ ] Electron IPC abstraction layer
- [ ] Bidirectional renderer ↔ main process communication
- [ ] Type-safe IPC event definitions
- [ ] Automatic serialization/deserialization
- [ ] IPC event batching for performance
- [ ] Connection state management

### Developer Experience

- [ ] Comprehensive documentation with examples
- [ ] Event debugging and inspection tools
- [ ] Testing utilities for event-driven code
- [ ] IPC-specific debugging tools

## Q1 2026 - Advanced Features

### Event Patterns

- [ ] Event namespacing and domain organization
- [ ] Event sourcing capabilities
- [ ] Event aggregation and batching
- [ ] Middleware and interceptor system

### Integration Points

- [ ] Blueprint workflow event integration
- [ ] Store package state change events
- [ ] UI component lifecycle events
- [ ] Real-time collaboration events

## Q2 2026 - Distributed Events

### Cross-System Communication

- [ ] WebSocket event synchronization
- [ ] Cross-window/tab communication
- [ ] Multi-user session coordination
- [ ] Event persistence and replay

### Performance & Reliability

- [ ] Event queue management
- [ ] Backpressure handling
- [ ] Event delivery guarantees
- [ ] Failure recovery mechanisms

## Q3 2026 - Advanced Capabilities

### Intelligence & Analytics

- [ ] Event pattern analysis
- [ ] Performance metrics and insights
- [ ] Automated event optimization
- [ ] Predictive event handling

### Ecosystem Integration

- [ ] Third-party service integrations
- [ ] Webhook support
- [ ] API event broadcasting
- [ ] Plugin system for custom events

## Future Considerations

### Next-Generation Features

- AI-driven event pattern recognition
- Distributed event sourcing across nodes
- Real-time collaborative editing events
- Blockchain-based event verification

### Platform Evolution

- Event-driven microservices architecture
- Cross-platform event synchronization
- Edge computing event distribution
- Global event consistency protocols

## Success Metrics

- **Reliability**: 99.9% event delivery success rate
- **Performance**: <10ms average event processing time
- **Developer Adoption**: Used in 90% of platform features
- **Scalability**: Handle 10,000+ concurrent events
