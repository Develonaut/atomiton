# Current Work - Conductor Package

## Sprint: January 11, 2025

### 🏗️ Package Setup - COMPLETE

**Completed Tasks:**

- [x] **Build configuration** - TypeScript and build scripts configured
- [x] **Blueprint storage** - Migrated to @atomiton/storage package
- [ ] **Core interfaces** - Define IExecutionEngine and IRuntime interfaces
- [ ] **Testing setup** - Configure Vitest for unit tests
- [ ] **ESLint config** - Add linting configuration

### 🎯 Execution Engine - NEXT

**Upcoming Tasks:**

- [ ] **ExecutionEngine class** - Core orchestration implementation
- [ ] **NodeExecutor** - Individual node execution
- [ ] **BlueprintRunner** - Blueprint workflow orchestration
- [ ] **Storage integration** - Use @atomiton/storage for Blueprint persistence

### 📋 Planning Phase - COMPLETE

**Completed January 11, 2025:**

- ✅ **Package created** - @atomiton/conductor structure established
- ✅ **Architecture documented** - Blueprint execution and runtime strategy
- ✅ **IPC strategy defined** - Integration with @atomiton/events
- ✅ **Storage abstraction** - Migrated to @atomiton/storage for universal platform support
- ✅ **MVP approach documented** - Pure TypeScript, no complexity

### 🔄 In Review

None

### ⚠️ Blocked

**Waiting on @atomiton/events IPC support:**

- Need IPC abstraction layer for renderer ↔ main communication
- Type-safe event definitions across process boundaries
- Automatic serialization/deserialization

## Notes

The conductor package orchestrates Blueprint and node execution. Starting with pure TypeScript implementation for MVP, with architecture designed to support future runtime flexibility through node versioning.

Key decisions:

- Desktop-first: Runs in Electron main process
- Storage: Universal abstraction via @atomiton/storage (supports filesystem, cloud, browser)
- Queue: p-queue for in-memory task management
- IPC: Via @atomiton/events unified API
