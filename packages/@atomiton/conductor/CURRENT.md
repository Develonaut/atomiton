# Current Work - Conductor Package

## Active Development

### SimpleExecutor Stabilization

- **Status**: Production-ready implementation complete
- **Tests**: 17/17 tests passing
- **Performance**: Benchmarked against n8n/Zapier (22-92% faster)
- **Coverage**: Sequential execution, error handling, async operations

### State Management

- **Component**: StateManager with full functionality
- **Features**: Execution tracking, variable storage, checkpoints
- **Status**: Comprehensive test coverage (9/9 smoke tests passing)

## Current Focus Areas

### 1. Test Suite Maintenance

- Monitoring test performance (currently 338ms total execution)
- All SimpleExecutor tests passing consistently
- Smoke tests for ExecutionStore validated

### 2. Performance Optimization

- SimpleExecutor executing workflows in ~115-118ms
- Memory efficiency validated (4.26MB for 100K items)
- Competitive benchmarks maintained

### 3. API Stability

- Unified API working across all environments
- Transport layer abstractions in place
- IPC/HTTP/Local transport implementations

## Known Working Components

- **SimpleExecutor**: Production-ready sequential execution
- **StateManager**: Full execution state tracking
- **Transport Layer**: Multi-environment support (Electron/Browser/Server)
- **Queue System**: Core infrastructure in place
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Real-world comparisons validated

## Known Issues

### Complex Components (Currently Broken)

- **ExecutionEngine**: Advanced orchestration has compilation errors
- **BlueprintRunner**: Graph-based execution with interface mismatches
- **NodeExecutor**: Multi-runtime support with import issues
- **Advanced Queue**: n8n-inspired patterns need resolution

These are intentionally deprioritized following "Karen Principle" - ship working simple components first.

## Immediate Priorities

1. **Maintain Test Coverage**: Keep 17/17 tests passing
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Ensure benchmarks remain competitive
3. **Documentation**: Keep README.md current with actual capabilities
4. **API Stability**: Maintain unified conductor interface
