# Completed Work - Conductor Package

## January 11, 2025

### ✅ Package Creation & Planning

**Deliverables:**

- ✅ **Package structure** - Created @atomiton/conductor with standard layout
- ✅ **Package rename** - Changed from runtime to conductor for better metaphor
- ✅ **Core documentation** - README, ROADMAP, CHANGELOG, TODO
- ✅ **Architecture docs** - Blueprint execution, runtime strategy, IPC integration

**Key Decisions Made:**

- **Name**: @atomiton/conductor (orchestrates execution like a musical conductor)
- **MVP Approach**: Pure TypeScript, no multi-language complexity
- **Storage**: YAML for human-readable Blueprint files
- **Execution**: Electron main process with Node.js APIs
- **IPC**: Leverage @atomiton/events for unified communication

### ✅ Documentation

**Completed Documents:**

- `README.md` - Package overview and MVP philosophy
- `ROADMAP.md` - 6-week implementation plan
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `TODO.md` - Detailed task breakdown
- `docs/README.md` - Architecture overview
- `docs/blueprint-execution.md` - Blueprint storage and execution details
- `docs/execution-strategy.md` - Runtime architecture decisions
- `docs/ipc-integration.md` - IPC communication strategy

### ✅ Integration Planning

**Cross-Package Coordination:**

- Updated @atomiton/events ROADMAP for IPC support
- Created IPC_REQUIREMENTS.md in events package
- Documented conductor's dependency on events package
- Established unified Node/Blueprint type hierarchy

## Metrics

- **Documentation**: 8 comprehensive documents created
- **Architecture**: 3 major design decisions documented
- **Planning**: 6-week roadmap established
- **Integration**: 2 packages coordinated

## Lessons Learned

- Conductor metaphor resonates better than runtime
- Desktop-first approach simplifies MVP significantly
- Node versioning enables future flexibility without breaking changes
- IPC abstraction through events package reduces complexity

**Total Completed Items**: 15
**Next Phase**: ExecutionEngine implementation

### ✅ Storage Architecture Migration

**Deliverables:**

- ✅ **Blueprint storage** - Moved BlueprintSerializer and storage classes to @atomiton/storage
- ✅ **Universal abstraction** - Adopted @atomiton/storage's IStorageEngine interface
- ✅ **Package integration** - Updated conductor to use storage package dependency
- ✅ **Documentation cleanup** - Updated ROADMAP and progress docs to reflect migration
- ✅ **Build system** - Conductor package builds successfully with new architecture

**Key Benefits Achieved:**

- **Platform flexibility** - Same storage API works on desktop, browser, and cloud
- **Future-proof** - Easy to add cloud storage providers (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox)
- **Separation of concerns** - Conductor focuses on orchestration, storage handles persistence
- **Testability** - Mock storage engines for reliable testing
