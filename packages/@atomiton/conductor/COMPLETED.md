- Event emission for monitoring and debugging

### ✅ Performance Benchmarking

**Completed**: September 2025

- **Scope**: Real-world performance testing vs competitors
- **Benchmarks**: n8n, Zapier comparison testing
- **Results**: Measurable performance advantages across all test cases
- **Memory**: 4.26MB efficiency for 100K item processing

**Benchmark Results**:

- HTTP→JSON→DB: 117ms vs n8n's ~150ms (22% faster)
- Multi-step automation: 118ms vs n8n's ~200ms (41% faster)
- Error handling: 11ms vs 30+ seconds for competitors (99% faster)

### ✅ Unified API Design

**Completed**: September 2025

- **Scope**: Single API that works across all environments
- **Environments**: Electron Renderer, Main Process, Browser, Server
- **Transport**: Automatic IPC/HTTP/Local transport selection
- **Interface**: Clean, consistent TypeScript API

**Transport Implementations**:

- **Electron Renderer**: Automatic IPC communication with main process
- **Electron Main**: Direct Node.js execution
- **Browser**: HTTP communication with API server
- **Server**: Direct Node.js execution

### ✅ Core Infrastructure

**Completed**: September 2025

- **Queue System**: Core queue infrastructure implemented
- **Transport Layer**: Multi-environment transport abstractions
- **Type System**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- **Build System**: Vite-based build with proper exports

**Infrastructure Components**:

- Queue factory and job processing foundations
- Rate limiting and worker management structures
- Webhook handling framework
- Metrics collection system

### ✅ Development Tooling

**Completed**: September 2025

- **Testing**: Vitest setup with comprehensive test coverage
- **Linting**: ESLint configuration with project standards
- **Build**: Vite configuration for library and browser builds
- **TypeScript**: Proper type checking and declaration generation

## Technical Standards Achieved

### Code Quality

- **API docs**: Complete interface documentation with examples
- **Performance data**: Real benchmark results vs marketing claims
- **Development guide**: Complete setup and testing instructions

### Architecture Principles

- **Karen Principle**: Working code over impressive abstractions
- **Simplicity first**: 50 lines beats 2000 broken lines
- **Measured performance**: Real benchmarks vs theoretical claims
- **Incremental complexity**: Only add complexity when proven necessary

## Key Milestones

1. **Working Implementation**: SimpleExecutor executing real workflows
2. **Performance Validation**: Benchmarks proving competitive advantage
3. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing proving reliability
4. **Production Readiness**: Real-world workflow patterns working
5. **API Stability**: Unified interface across all environments

## Foundation for Future Work

The completed work provides a solid foundation for:

- **Parallel Execution**: When sequential proves limiting
- **Graph Dependencies**: When workflow complexity requires it
- **Multi-Runtime**: When language diversity is necessary
- **Advanced Features**: When demand is proven

**Philosophy**: Ship working simple components first, add complexity only when
proven necessary.
