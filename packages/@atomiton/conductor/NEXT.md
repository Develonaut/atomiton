# Next Work - Conductor Package

## Upcoming Sprint: Week 2 (January 2025)

### ðŸŽ¯ Basic Execution Implementation

**Priority Tasks:**

- [ ] **ExecutionEngine class** - Core orchestration implementation
- [x] ~~**BlueprintSerializer**~~ - _Migrated to @atomiton/storage_
- [x] ~~**BlueprintStorage**~~ - _Migrated to @atomiton/storage_
- [ ] **Storage integration** - Use @atomiton/storage for Blueprint persistence
- [ ] **Sequential execution** - Execute nodes in order
- [ ] **Data flow** - Pass data between connected nodes
- [ ] **Context management** - Execution context and state

### ðŸ”§ Core Components

**To Build:**

- [ ] **NodeExecutor** - Execute individual nodes
- [ ] **BlueprintRunner** - Orchestrate Blueprint execution
- [ ] **StateManager** - Track execution state
- [ ] **Error handling** - Basic error capture and reporting

### ðŸ“Š Testing Infrastructure

**Test Coverage:**

- [ ] **Unit tests** - ExecutionEngine core logic
- [ ] **Integration tests** - Simple workflow execution
- [ ] **Performance tests** - Measure execution overhead
- [ ] **Error scenarios** - Test failure modes

## Dependencies

### Required First

- âœ… @atomiton/nodes - Node definitions and interfaces
- âœ… @atomiton/storage - Blueprint persistence and storage abstraction
- ðŸš§ @atomiton/events - IPC support (in progress)

### Will Enable

- Editor integration - Execute Blueprints from UI
- Real-time progress - Execution status updates
- Debug capabilities - Step through execution

## Success Criteria

- Execute 10-node linear workflow
- < 100ms execution overhead
- All tests passing
- Zero memory leaks

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk               | Mitigation                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| IPC not ready      | Build with mock EventBus first |
| Complex edge cases | Start with simple linear flows |
| Performance issues | Profile early and often        |
