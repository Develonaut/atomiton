# Next Planned Work - Conductor Package

## Immediate Next Steps (Current Sprint)

### 1. Complex Component Resolution

**Priority**: Medium (when demand proven)

- **ExecutionEngine**: Fix compilation errors in advanced orchestration
- **BlueprintRunner**: Resolve interface mismatches for graph-based execution
- **NodeExecutor**: Fix import issues in multi-runtime support
- **Advanced Queue**: Resolve n8n-inspired pattern dependencies

### 2. Feature Enhancements

**Priority**: Low (ship simple first)

- **Parallel Execution**: True parallel node execution (currently sequential only)
- **Graph Dependencies**: Blueprint dependency resolution
- **Runtime Support**: Multi-runtime (Rust/WASM/Python) integration

### 3. Integration Improvements

**Priority**: Medium

- **Error Recovery**: Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
- **Monitoring**: Advanced execution monitoring and debugging
- **Webhook System**: Enhanced webhook handling capabilities

## Development Approach

Following **Karen Principle**: "Is it ACTUALLY working or are you just saying it is?"

### Phase 1: Stabilize Working Components

- Keep SimpleExecutor at 100% test coverage
- Maintain performance benchmarks vs competitors
- Ensure unified API consistency across environments

### Phase 2: Incremental Complexity (Only When Proven Needed)

- Add parallel execution when sequential proves limiting
- Implement graph dependencies when workflow complexity requires it
- Add multi-runtime support when language diversity is proven necessary

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Demand-Driven)

- CLI interface (when users request it)
- Advanced scaling and queueing (when volume requires it)
- Complex orchestration patterns (when use cases emerge)

## Validation Requirements

Before any feature moves to development:

1. **Proven Need**: Real user demand or performance limitation
2. **Working Foundation**: Current components remain stable
3. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing for new features
4. **Performance**: Maintain competitive advantage

## Non-Goals

- Complex abstractions without proven need
- Features that break existing simple API
- Performance regressions vs current benchmarks
- Multi-runtime support before TypeScript limitations are hit

## Success Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 100% pass rate
- **Performance**: Keep 22-92% advantage vs competitors
- **API Stability**: Zero breaking changes to unified interface
- **Production Readiness**: All shipped features work in real deployments
