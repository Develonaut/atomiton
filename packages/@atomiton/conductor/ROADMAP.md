Phase 3: DistributedExecutor (multi-machine)
    ↓
Phase 4: HybridExecutor (multi-runtime support)
```

### Performance Targets

| Phase   | Target | Benchmark           |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| Current | 115ms  | 22% faster than n8n |
| Phase 1 | 50ms   | 60% faster than n8n |
| Phase 2 | 30ms   | 80% faster than n8n |
| Phase 3 | 15ms   | 90% faster than n8n |

### Architecture Principles

#### Backwards Compatibility

- **API Stability**: Unified conductor interface never breaks
- **Migration Path**: Clear upgrade paths for all versions
- **Deprecation Policy**: 6-month notice for breaking changes

#### Performance First

- **Measure Everything**: Real benchmarks vs theoretical performance
- **Regression Testing**: Continuous performance validation
- **Memory Efficiency**: Constant memory usage regardless of complexity

#### Developer Experience

- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box
- **TypeScript First**: Full type safety and IntelliSense
- **Debugging Support**: Rich debugging and inspection tools

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics

- **Performance**: Maintain competitive advantage vs n8n/Zapier
- **Reliability**: 99.9% execution success rate
- **Test Coverage**: 100% test coverage for all shipped features

- **Breaking Changes**: Conservative API evolution with deprecation periods

### Market Risks

- **Competitor Evolution**: Stay ahead through innovation and performance
- **Technology Shifts**: Flexible architecture supporting new runtimes
- **Scale Challenges**: Proactive scaling architecture design

## Decision Framework

### Adding New Features

1. **Proven Demand**: Real user requests or performance limitations
2. **Working Foundation**: Current features remain stable
3. **Performance Impact**: No regression in core benchmarks
4. **Complexity Justification**: Clear benefit vs added complexity

### Technology Choices

1. **Performance First**: Measurable performance improvement
2. **TypeScript Compatibility**: Maintain type safety
3. **Cross-Platform**: Works in all target environments
4. **Community Support**: Active ecosystem and maintenance

## Long-term Vision

**5-Year Goal**: Conductor becomes the standard for workflow orchestration
across industries, known for:

- **Unmatched Performance**: Consistently fastest execution engine
- **Developer Experience**: Easiest platform to build and deploy workflows
- **Reliability**: Most stable and predictable execution platform
- **Ecosystem**: Richest community and integration ecosystem

**10-Year Goal**: Conductor powers the next generation of automation platforms,
enabling:
