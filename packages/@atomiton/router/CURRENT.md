# Current Work - @atomiton/router

## Overview

Clean, simplified wrapper around TanStack Router providing type-safe routing
with minimal abstraction. The package has been significantly simplified to
eliminate over-engineering while maintaining essential functionality.

## Current Status: September 2025

### ðŸŽ¯ Package State: Simplified & Production Ready

Major simplification completed - reduced from ~1930 lines across 19+ files to
174 lines across 4 focused files (91% reduction). The package now serves as a
thin, clean wrapper around TanStack Router without unnecessary abstractions.

### ðŸš€ Current Capabilities

#### Core Features

- âœ… **TanStack Router Integration**: Clean wrapper around TanStack Router
- âœ… **Component Lazy Loading**: Built-in lazy loading for route components
- âœ… **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all APIs
- âœ… **Minimal Abstraction**: Thin wrapper without over-engineering
- âœ… **React Integration**: Seamless React hooks and components

#### API Structure

- âœ… **createRouter()**: Main factory function returning clean API
- âœ… **Navigation**: TanStack Router's navigation function
- âœ… **React Hooks**: useRouter, useNavigate, useParams, useLocation
- âœ… **Components**: Link and RouterProvider components
- âœ… **Loading States**: Configurable loading components for lazy routes

### ðŸ”§ Active Usage

Currently being used by:

- **apps/client**: Primary application routing and navigation
- **Navigation helpers**: App-specific navigation utilities moved to
  apps/client/router/

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus: Stability & Simplicity

**Primary Goal**: Maintain simplified, stable routing wrapper

**Recent Work**:

- âœ… Major simplification: 91% code reduction (1930 â†’ 174 lines)
- âœ… Eliminated over-engineered abstractions and custom state management
- âœ… Clean wrapper around TanStack Router
- âœ… All quality checks passing (TypeScript, ESLint, tests, build)
- âœ… Karen approval as production-ready

## Core Architecture

### Clean Wrapper Design

Simple route configuration with minimal abstraction:

```typescript
{
  name: "editor",
  path: "/editor/$blueprintId",
  component: () => import("./pages/EditorPage"),
  pendingComponent: LoadingSpinner,
  errorComponent: ErrorBoundary
}
```

### TanStack Router Integration

Direct use of TanStack Router APIs:

- `navigate({ to: "/path", params: { id: "123" } })` for navigation
- Standard TanStack Router hooks and components
- No custom abstractions or state management

### Component Loading

Built-in lazy loading with loading states:

- Automatic component lazy loading
- Configurable loading components per route
- Error boundary support for failed loads

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies

- `@tanstack/react-router`: Modern React routing foundation
- `react`: React 18+ for concurrent features and hooks

### No Additional Dependencies

The simplified implementation has minimal dependencies:

- No custom state management libraries
- No path parsing utilities beyond TanStack Router
- No complex abstractions or utility dependencies

## Integration Points

### Client Application

The router package provides basic routing capabilities:

- Simple routing configuration using createRouter()
- Component lazy loading with loading states
- Standard TanStack Router navigation patterns
- Thin wrapper without business logic coupling

### Navigation Helpers

App-specific navigation utilities have been moved to `apps/client/router/`:

- Custom navigation methods and utilities
- Application-specific routing logic
- Complex navigation patterns and state management

## Quality Metrics

### Simplicity

- âœ… Codebase: 174 lines across 4 files (91% reduction from original)
- âœ… Bundle size: Minimal overhead over TanStack Router
- âœ… API surface: Clean, focused API without over-engineering
- âœ… Dependencies: Minimal dependency footprint

### Reliability

- âœ… All quality checks passing: TypeScript, ESLint, tests, build
- âœ… Type safety: 100% TypeScript coverage for public APIs
- âœ… Production ready: Karen-approved and stable
- âœ… Browser compatibility: Modern browsers via TanStack Router

### Maintainability

- âœ… Clear separation: 4 focused files with single responsibilities
- âœ… No abstractions: Direct TanStack Router usage
- âœ… Simple debugging: Standard TanStack Router debugging tools
- âœ… Documentation: Accurate, concise API documentation
