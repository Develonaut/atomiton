# Next Work Queue - @atomiton/editor

## Overview

Upcoming work for the @atomiton/editor package, prioritized by user impact and
technical dependencies.

## Priority Queue

### 1. ðŸ”´ Node Configuration System (Critical - Current Sprint)

**Why Critical**: Users can add nodes but cannot fully configure them, limiting
workflow creation capabilities.

**Progress**: Architecture designed, basic display working, editable controls
needed

**Tasks**:

- [x] Connect selection state to inspector display
- [x] Design configuration system architecture
- [ ] Build editable property field components (following
      [architecture](../../docs/architecture/NODE_CONFIGURATION_SYSTEM.md)):
  - [ ] `TextField` for string inputs with validation
  - [ ] `NumberField` with min/max validation
  - [ ] `SelectField` for enum dropdowns
  - [ ] `SwitchField` for boolean values
  - [ ] `SliderField` for numeric ranges
  - [ ] `JsonEditor` for object configuration
  - [ ] `ArrayField` for list management
- [ ] Implement React Hook Form integration
- [ ] Create Zod schema-to-UI mapper
- [ ] Add real-time property updates to store
- [ ] Support comprehensive validation and error display

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- All node property types can be edited through appropriate controls
- Schema-driven form generation works automatically
- Changes update store and validate in real-time
- Property panels support conditional fields and complex data types

---

### 2. ðŸ”´ Data Flow Connections (Critical - Next Sprint)

**Why Critical**: Without connections, nodes are isolated and workflows cannot
function.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Implement connection ports on nodes
- [ ] Add visual connection handles
- [ ] Create connection drag interaction
- [ ] Implement connection validation rules
- [ ] Add connection path rendering
- [ ] Support connection deletion
- [ ] Show data type compatibility

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users can drag from output to input ports
- Invalid connections are prevented
- Connections show data flow direction
- Connection paths are smooth and readable

---

### 3. ðŸŸ¡ Workflow Execution (High Priority)

**Why Important**: The core value of the editor is running automations.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Add Run/Stop buttons to toolbar
- [ ] Integrate with @atomiton/core execution engine
- [ ] Show execution state on nodes (running/complete/error)
- [ ] Display execution progress
- [ ] Show data flowing through connections
- [ ] Implement debug mode with breakpoints
- [ ] Add execution logs panel

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Workflows can be executed from the editor
- Visual feedback shows execution progress
- Errors are clearly displayed
- Users can debug step-by-step

---

### 4. ðŸŸ¡ Save/Load Flows (High Priority)

**Why Important**: Users need to persist their work.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Implement Flow serialization format
- [ ] Add Save button/command
- [ ] Add Load dialog
- [ ] Support .atom file format
- [ ] Implement auto-save
- [ ] Add version tracking
- [ ] Support import/export

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Flows can be saved to files
- Loading restores exact state
- File format is human-readable
- Auto-save prevents data loss

---

### 5. ðŸŸ¢ Enhanced Canvas Features (Medium Priority)

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Multi-select with shift/cmd
- [ ] Copy/paste nodes
- [ ] Duplicate nodes
- [ ] Align and distribute tools
- [ ] Group/ungroup nodes
- [ ] Node search/filter
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Context menus

---

### 6. ðŸŸ¢ Property Editor Enhancements (Medium Priority)

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Dynamic property schemas
- [ ] Custom property editors
- [ ] Property templates
- [ ] Conditional properties
- [ ] Property validation rules
- [ ] Rich editors (color picker, date picker)
- [ ] Array/object editors

---

### 7. ðŸŸ¢ Visual Enhancements (Medium Priority)

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Node icons and thumbnails
- [ ] Custom node colors/themes
- [ ] Connection animations
- [ ] Execution visualizations
- [ ] Error state styling
- [ ] Success indicators
- [ ] Loading states

---

### 8. ðŸ”µ Developer Experience (Low Priority)

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Node development tools
- [ ] Custom node templates
- [ ] Extension API
- [ ] Plugin system
- [ ] Performance profiling
- [ ] Debug overlays

---

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Increase test coverage to 80%
- [ ] Optimize re-renders in large graphs
- [ ] Improve TypeScript types
- [ ] Document component APIs
- [ ] Add Storybook stories
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

## Research & Exploration

- [ ] WebAssembly for performance
- [ ] GPU acceleration for rendering
- [ ] Alternative layout algorithms
- [ ] Real-time collaboration
- [ ] AI-assisted node configuration
- [ ] Voice commands

## Success Metrics

### Short Term (2 weeks)

- âœ… Node Inspector working
- âœ… Basic connections functional
- âœ… Can create simple workflows

### Medium Term (1 month)

- âœ… Workflows can execute
- âœ… Flows can be saved/loaded
- âœ… 10+ example workflows created

### Long Term (3 months)

- âœ… Full feature parity with competitors
- âœ… < 100ms response time for all operations
- âœ… Support for 1000+ node workflows
