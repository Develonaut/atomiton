# Blueprint Editor Roadmap

## Vision

Build the most intuitive and powerful visual workflow editor for automation. The @atomiton/editor provides a React-based, node-based interface that makes complex automation accessible to non-developers while maintaining the flexibility needed by power users.

## Current State (v0.0.1)

We have a working foundation with React Flow integration, basic canvas functionality, node palette, and initial property inspection. The editor can display nodes and basic properties but lacks full configuration, connections, and execution capabilities.

## Phase 1: Foundation (‚úÖ PARTIALLY COMPLETE)

**Timeline**: Completed January 2025

### Achieved

- ‚úÖ React Flow integration with canvas, pan, zoom
- ‚úÖ Editor store with Zustand state management
- ‚úÖ Node palette showing available nodes from @atomiton/core
- ‚úÖ Basic node selection and scene management
- ‚úÖ Left sidebar (Scene/Assets) and right sidebar (Design/Animation)
- ‚úÖ Basic node property display
- ‚úÖ Toolbar with essential controls

### Remaining Foundation Work

- üî¥ Full node configuration system (CRITICAL)
- üî¥ Data flow connections between nodes
- üü° Save/load Blueprint functionality

## Design Principles

1. **Intuitive First** - Non-developers should understand the interface immediately
2. **Performance Focused** - Smooth interactions even with complex workflows
3. **Extensible** - Easy to add new node types and features
4. **Beautiful** - Professional, modern design that users enjoy
5. **Reliable** - Stable, predictable behavior with comprehensive error handling

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

- **Canvas**: React Flow-based workflow canvas
- **Inspector**: Property configuration panels
- **Palette**: Available node library
- **Toolbar**: Primary actions and controls
- **Organization**: Workflow structure management

### Integration Points

- **@atomiton/core** - Node definitions and execution engine
