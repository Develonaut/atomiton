| ----------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Firefox** | Current         | Progress visualization works, but transitions are not smooth due to lack of CSS `@property` support |

## Known Limitations

### Firefox - CSS `@property` Not Supported

**Issue**: Firefox does not support CSS `@property` for custom property
animations.

**Impact**: Progress updates will be instant rather than smoothly animated. The
visualization still works correctly, but users won't see the gradual filling of
progress borders.

**Affected Code**:

```css
/* This smooth transition works in Chrome/Edge/Safari but not Firefox */
@property --progress {
  syntax: "<number>";
  initial-value: 0;
  inherits: false;
}

.atomiton-node::before {
  transition: --progress 0.3s ease;
}
```

**Workaround**: None currently available. Firefox users will see progress
updates but without smooth transitions.

**Status**: Firefox team is aware of the feature request. Track at:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1864818

### Older Browsers

Browsers older than the minimum versions listed above may experience:

- No progress visualization
- Layout issues with React Flow
- Performance degradation

**Recommendation**: Use the latest stable version of a supported browser.

## Performance Characteristics

### Expected Performance (on modern hardware)

| Metric                   | Chrome/Edge | Safari | Firefox |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ------ | ------- |
| **FPS during execution** | 60fps       | 60fps  | 60fps   |
| **CPU usage**            | <30%        | <30%   | <30%    |
| **Memory overhead**      | <50MB       | <50MB  | <50MB   |
| **Nodes supported**      | 500+        | 500+   | 500+    |

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Direct DOM manipulation**: Progress updates bypass React re-renders for
   60fps performance
2. **GPU acceleration**: Animations use CSS transforms and custom properties
3. **Cached DOM references**: `.closest()` calls are cached to avoid repeated
   traversals
4. **Efficient lookups**: Uses `Array.find()` for small node counts (optimal for
   3-50 nodes)

## Testing Your Browser

To verify browser compatibility:

1. Open the Atomiton editor in your browser
2. Execute a flow with multiple nodes
3. Observe the progress visualization:
   - **Smooth transitions**: Chrome/Edge/Safari (borders gradually fill)
   - **Instant updates**: Firefox (borders update immediately)
   - **Error states**: Red borders should appear on failed nodes

## Browser Detection

The editor automatically detects browser capabilities and adapts:

```typescript
// Automatic feature detection in useNodeExecutionState hook
const supportsAtProperty = (() => {
  try {
    return (
      CSS.supports("(--test: 0deg)") && CSS.supports("transition: --test 0.3s")
    );
  } catch {
    return false;
  }
})();
```

## Troubleshooting

### Progress Not Updating

**Symptoms**: Node borders don't show execution progress

**Possible Causes**:

1. Browser doesn't support CSS custom properties (very old browsers)
2. JavaScript disabled
3. DOM structure doesn't include required classes (`.react-flow__node`,
   `.atomiton-node`)

**Solution**: Update to a supported browser version

### Slow or Laggy Animation

**Symptoms**: Progress updates are choppy or delayed

**Possible Causes**:

1. High CPU usage from other applications
2. Hardware acceleration disabled
3. Too many nodes executing in parallel (>100)

**Solutions**:

1. Close unnecessary browser tabs
2. Enable hardware acceleration in browser settings
3. Reduce parallelism in flows (use sequential execution)

### Firefox - No Smooth Transitions

**Symptoms**: Progress jumps from 0 to 100 instantly or updates in steps

**Expected**: This is normal Firefox behavior due to `@property` limitation

**Status**: Working as designed. Firefox users get instant updates instead of
smooth transitions.

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **WebGL fallback for Firefox**: Provide smooth animations using WebGL when
   CSS transitions aren't available
2. **Progressive enhancement**: Detect `@property` support and enable enhanced
   features dynamically
3. **Performance profiling**: Auto-adjust animation complexity based on device
   capabilities

### Browser Feature Requests

editor:
