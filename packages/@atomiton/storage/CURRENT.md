# Current Work - Storage Package

## Sprint: January 11, 2025

### üèóÔ∏è Package Setup - IN PROGRESS

**Active Tasks:**

- [x] **Package structure** - Created @atomiton/storage with TypeScript config
- [x] **Core interfaces** - Defined IStorageEngine and universal API
- [ ] **Factory function** - Implement createStorage with platform detection
- [ ] **Base classes** - Create AbstractStorageEngine base class
- [ ] **Error handling** - Implement StorageError types and context

### üìã Planning Phase - COMPLETE

**Completed January 11, 2025:**

- ‚úÖ **Architecture designed** - Universal storage abstraction for multi-platform support
- ‚úÖ **Storage types defined** - Filesystem, IndexedDB, cloud providers (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox)
- ‚úÖ **API interface designed** - Consistent save/load/list/delete operations across platforms
- ‚úÖ **Platform strategy** - Auto-detection based on environment (desktop/browser/cloud)
- ‚úÖ **Cloud integration planned** - Support for major cloud storage providers
- ‚úÖ **Tier-based features** - Different limits/features per subscription tier

### üîÑ In Review

None

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked

**Future cloud provider integrations:**

- Need API credentials and OAuth setup for Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox
- Cloud provider rate limits and quota management
- Authentication flow design across platforms

## Notes

The storage package provides universal storage abstraction that allows the same API to work across desktop (filesystem), browser (IndexedDB), and cloud storage providers (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox). This ensures the app can run anywhere without caring about storage implementation details.

Key architectural decisions:

- **Platform Agnostic**: Auto-detection of best storage type per environment
- **Future Proof**: Easy to add new storage backends without app changes
- **Cloud Ready**: Built-in support for popular cloud storage providers
- **Tier-Based**: Different storage limits/features per subscription level
- **Testing**: Mock and memory storage for reliable testing

This abstraction will enable:

- Desktop app with local file storage
- Browser app with IndexedDB + optional cloud sync
- Future cloud hosting with managed backend storage
- User choice of cloud storage provider (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox)
