# Storage Package Security Plans

> **Note**: This document contains package-specific security planning. For the
> complete project security architecture, see
> [Security Architecture](../../docs/architecture/SECURITY.md).

## Current Security Status

⚠️ **NO SECURITY IMPLEMENTED** - This is a planning document only.

**What exists now:**

- Basic filesystem storage with NO encryption
- NO credential storage
- NO keychain integration
- NO secure APIs

**What this document describes:**

- Future security implementation plans
- Research tasks needed
- Proposed security architecture

## Planned Security Scope

**What Storage Package Plans to Own:**

- Secure credential storage (API keys, tokens, passwords) - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Flow content encryption at rest - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Cross-platform secure storage abstraction - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Platform-specific keychain/credential manager integration - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Data encryption/decryption for sensitive content - NOT IMPLEMENTED

**What It Won't Own:**

- User authentication (handled by Supabase integration)
- Network security (TLS, etc.)
- Application-level authorization

## PLANNED Platform-Specific Secure Storage (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### Desktop (Electron) - Proposed Implementation

**PLANNED Implementation Strategy: Electron safeStorage API**

```typescript
// PROPOSED implementation (DOES NOT EXIST)
import { safeStorage } from "electron";

// This class does NOT exist yet
export class ElectronSecureStorage implements ISecureStorage {
  // ... proposed implementation
}
```

**PLANNED Security Properties:**

- Encryption keys stored in OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential
  Manager, Linux Secret Service)
- Additional encryption layer to prevent cross-app access
- Data only accessible to current user account
- Automatic cleanup on app uninstall

**Current Reality:** None of this is implemented.

### Browser/Cloud - Future Planning Only

**PROPOSED Browser Strategy (NOT IMPLEMENTED):**

- Use Web Crypto API for additional encryption
- Store encrypted credentials in IndexedDB
- Server-side encrypted storage for team/shared credentials

**PROPOSED Cloud Strategy (NOT IMPLEMENTED):**

- Supabase encrypted storage for shared team credentials
- Individual user credentials remain on desktop only
- End-to-end encryption for synced data

**Current Reality:** No browser or cloud security features exist.

## Research Tasks for Storage Package

### Immediate Research Required

1. **Electron safeStorage Deep Dive**
   - Study VS Code's implementation approach
   - Understand encryption key derivation and storage
   - Research cross-platform compatibility edge cases
   - Test security boundaries and limitations

2. **OS Keychain Integration**
   - macOS Keychain Services API usage patterns
   - Windows Credential Manager best practices
   - Linux Secret Service compatibility (GNOME vs KDE)
   - Error handling for locked/unavailable keychains

3. **Double Encryption Strategy**
   - Additional encryption layer design (AES-256-GCM?)
   - Key derivation from user password or hardware
   - Performance impact of double encryption
   - Key rotation and migration strategies

4. **Data Categorization**
   - Which data requires secure storage vs regular storage
   - API key vs authentication token handling
   - Team/shared vs personal credential models
   - Backup and sync considerations for encrypted data

### Storage Interface Design

```typescript
// Planned interfaces for storage package
export interface ISecureStorage {
  // API Keys and sensitive credentials
  storeCredential(service: string, key: string, value: string): Promise<void>;
  retrieveCredential(service: string, key: string): Promise<string | null>;
  deleteCredential(service: string, key: string): Promise<void>;
  listCredentials(service?: string): Promise<string[]>;

  // Encrypted Flow data
  storeEncrypted(path: string, data: Flow): Promise<void>;
  retrieveEncrypted(path: string): Promise<Flow | null>;

  // Storage health and diagnostics
  isSecureStorageAvailable(): boolean;
  getSecurityInfo(): Promise<SecurityInfo>;
}

export interface SecurityInfo {
  platform: "desktop" | "browser" | "cloud";
  encryptionAvailable: boolean;
  keystore:
    | "keychain"
    | "credential-manager"
    | "secret-service"
    | "browser"
    | "server";
  additionalEncryption: boolean;
}
```

### Security Best Practices for Implementation

1. **Defense in Depth**
   - OS keychain + additional encryption layer
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Secure memory handling (zero out after use)
   - Audit logging for credential access

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation when secure storage unavailable
   - Clear error messages without exposing sensitive data
   - Fallback strategies for different OS configurations
   - User notification for security status changes

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Mock secure storage for automated tests
   - Security-specific test cases
   - Cross-platform compatibility testing
   - Performance benchmarks for encryption operations

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Research & Design (2 weeks)

- [ ] Research Electron safeStorage implementation details
- [ ] Study VS Code's security model and code
- [ ] Design secure storage interfaces
- [ ] Plan cross-platform compatibility strategy

### Phase 2: Desktop Implementation (3 weeks)

- [ ] Implement ElectronSecureStorage class
- [ ] Add OS-specific keychain integration
- [ ] Create double encryption layer
- [ ] Build comprehensive test suite

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (2 weeks)

- [ ] Integrate with existing storage abstractions
- [ ] Add security monitoring and diagnostics
- [ ] Performance optimization and benchmarking
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing

### Phase 4: Browser/Cloud Extension (Future)

- [ ] Extend to browser environments
- [ ] Add server-side encrypted storage
- [ ] Implement sync strategies for encrypted data

## Migration from Current State

**Current State:**

- No secure credential storage implemented
- Basic file system storage only
- No encryption at rest

**Migration Path:**

1. Add secure storage as optional feature
2. Migrate existing users to secure storage on next login
3. Provide migration tools for existing data
4. Maintain backward compatibility during transition

## Integration Points

**With Main Application:**

```typescript
// How the app will use secure storage
import { createStorage } from "@atomiton/storage";

const storage = await createStorage({
  type: "secure",
  platform: "desktop",
});

// Store API key
await storage.storeCredential("openai", "api-key", userApiKey);

// Retrieve for use
const apiKey = await storage.retrieveCredential("openai", "api-key");
```

**With Flow Engine:**

- Automatic encryption for Flows containing sensitive data
- Transparent decryption during Flow loading
- Secure handling of node configurations with credentials

## Success Metrics

1. **Security**: Zero credential exposure in logs, memory dumps, or filesystem
2. **Reliability**: 99.9% successful credential storage/retrieval
3. **Performance**: < 100ms overhead for encryption/decryption
4. **Compatibility**: Works on all supported desktop platforms
5. **Usability**: Transparent to end users, no additional configuration required
