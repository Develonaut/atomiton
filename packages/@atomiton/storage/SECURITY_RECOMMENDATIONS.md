# Security Implementation Recommendations

> **Note**: This document contains detailed research and implementation
> recommendations. For the complete project security architecture, see

## Research Summary

Based on comprehensive research into VS Code, major Electron apps (Discord,
Slack, Figma, etc.), and security best practices, combined with Voorhees'
complexity review, here are the actionable recommendations for implementing
secure storage in the @atomiton/storage package.

## The Voorhees Verdict: Simple and Secure

**Complexity Assessment**: Michael's proposed architecture was over-engineered
at 7/10 complexity. Voorhees slashed it to 2/10 - a 25-line implementation that
ships in 2 days instead of 6 weeks.

**Key Principle**: We're storing API keys for a desktop automation tool, not
building a bank vault.

## Recommended Implementation

### Phase 1: Minimal Viable Security (Ship This First)

**Technology Stack:**

- **Primary**: Electron's `safeStorage` API (industry standard as of 2025)
- **Fallback**: None - fail gracefully if secure storage unavailable
- **Dependencies**: Zero additional security libraries needed

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// 25-line secure storage implementation
import { safeStorage } from "electron";

export class SecureStorage {
  isAvailable(): boolean {
    return safeStorage.isEncryptionAvailable();
  }

  async store(key: string, value: string): Promise<void> {
    if (!this.isAvailable()) {
      throw new Error("Secure storage not available");
    }

    const encrypted = safeStorage.encryptString(value);
    // Store in app data directory with .enc extension
    await fs.writeFile(`${app.getPath("userData")}/${key}.enc`, encrypted);
  }

  async retrieve(key: string): Promise<string | null> {
    if (!this.isAvailable()) return null;

    try {
      const encrypted = await fs.readFile(
        `${app.getPath("userData")}/${key}.enc`,
      );
      return safeStorage.decryptString(encrypted);
    } catch {
      return null;
    }
  }

  async delete(key: string): Promise<void> {
    await fs.unlink(`${app.getPath("userData")}/${key}.enc`).catch(() => {});
  }
}
```

**Security Properties:**

- Encryption keys stored in OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential
  Manager, Linux Secret Service)
- Data encrypted at rest in app data directory
- Only accessible to current user and Atomiton app
- Zero additional attack surface from custom crypto

## Research Findings

### What Works (Copy This)

**From VS Code:**

- ✅ Simple 4-method API interface (`store`, `retrieve`, `delete`, `list`)
- ✅ Platform abstraction concept
- ✅ Graceful degradation when secure storage unavailable

**From Industry Leaders (Discord, Slack, etc.):**

- ✅ Electron `safeStorage` as primary method (replaced deprecated `keytar`)
- ✅ OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for authentication flows
- ✅ OS-native keychain integration
- ✅ Separation of UI (Electron) from business logic

### What's Broken (Avoid This)

**From VS Code:**

- ❌ No security isolation between extensions
- ❌ Predictable storage locations
- ❌ Fundamentally broken cryptography implementation
- ❌ False sense of security

**Common Anti-Patterns:**

- ❌ Plain text credential storage
- ❌ Using deprecated libraries (keytar)
- ❌ Storing sensitive business logic in Electron layer
- ❌ Complex custom encryption schemes

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Core Implementation

```typescript
// Simple interface - copy VS Code's approach
interface ISecureStorage {
  store(key: string, value: string): Promise<void>;
  retrieve(key: string): Promise<string | null>;
  delete(key: string): Promise<void>;
  list(): Promise<string[]>;
}
```

### Week 2: Integration

- Add to storage package factory
- Integrate with existing storage abstractions
- Add error handling and user feedback

### Week 3: Testing & Documentation

- Test on all platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Document limitations and requirements
- Add usage examples

## Security Guarantees

**What This Provides:**

- API keys encrypted at rest using OS-native encryption
- Data only accessible to current user and Atomiton app
- Platform-appropriate security (Keychain, Credential Manager, etc.)
- Simple, auditable implementation

**What This Doesn't Provide:**

- Protection if OS user account is compromised
- Protection from sophisticated malware with admin access
- Enterprise audit logging or compliance features
- Cross-app secret sharing

## Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

**Only implement if actually needed:**

1. **Enhanced Security (Phase 2)**
   - Additional encryption layer for paranoid users
   - Hardware security module integration
   - Enterprise audit logging

2. **Team Features (Phase 3)**
   - Shared team credentials via Supabase
   - Role-based access control
   - Credential rotation policies

3. **Compliance (Enterprise)**
   - SOC 2 compliance features
   - GDPR compliance tools
   - Audit trail capabilities

## Library Recommendations

**Primary Dependencies:**

- **Electron built-in `safeStorage`** - No additional dependencies needed

**Avoid These:**

- `keytar` - Deprecated, use Electron safeStorage instead
- `node-keychain` - Platform-specific, Electron handles this
- Custom crypto libraries - Over-engineering for this use case

**For Future (If Needed):**

- `libsodium/sodium-native` - If we need additional encryption later
- OAuth libraries - For authentication flows (separate concern)

## Testing Strategy

**Security Testing:**

- Verify encryption keys stored in OS keychain
- Test platform compatibility (macOS, Windows, Linux variants)
- Verify data inaccessible from other applications
- Test graceful degradation when secure storage unavailable

**Integration Testing:**

- Mock secure storage for automated tests
- Test error conditions and recovery
- Performance benchmarks for encryption operations

## Migration from Current State

**Current State:** No secure storage **Target State:** Simple, working secure
storage

**Migration Steps:**

1. Implement SecureStorage class in storage package
2. Add as optional feature in storage factory
3. Provide user migration prompts for existing API keys
4. Maintain backward compatibility during transition

- Michael: Security architecture patterns (complexity-reviewed)

**Recommendation:** Implement the simple 25-line approach and ship it.
Everything else is premature optimization.
