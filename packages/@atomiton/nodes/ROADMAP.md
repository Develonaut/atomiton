# Nodes Development Roadmap

## Vision

Build 20-50 exceptional nodes that cover 80% of automation use cases, emphasizing quality over quantity and leveraging desktop-first capabilities.

## Competitive Analysis Insights

Based on our [competitive analysis](../../../docs/nodes/analysis/), we've identified key market requirements and opportunities:

### Market Standards (MVP Table Stakes)

- **Canvas navigation**: Pan, zoom, multi-select with keyboard shortcuts
- **Real-time data preview**: Instant feedback at each node
- **Visual connections**: Drag-to-connect with auto-routing
- **Execution control**: Run, stop, partial execution, debugging
- **Node discovery**: Searchable library with categories
- **Error handling**: Clear error states and debugging information

### Competitive Advantages (Our Differentiators)

- **Superior undo/redo**: Full action history including deleted nodes with code
- **Advanced debugging**: Breakpoints, step-through execution, data inspection
- **Enhanced visualization**: Beyond JSON/table - charts, graphs, data profiling
- **Performance at scale**: Optimized for 100+ node workflows
- **Collaborative features**: Real-time multi-user editing from day one
- **Progressive complexity**: Simple mode for beginners, advanced for pros

## MVP Strategy: Workflow-Driven Development

### Core Principle

Start with real workflows to identify essential nodes. Each node should enable multiple use cases rather than serving a single purpose.

### MVP Target Workflow: Product Image Automation

**Workflow**: CSV → Blender Renders → Figma Overlays → Composite Images → Output Directory

This workflow validates our core nodes by requiring:

- Data ingestion (CSV/Spreadsheet)
- File system operations (directories, read/write)
- External tool integration (Blender, Figma API)
- Image processing (compositing)
- Batch processing (loop through products)
- Parallel execution (speed optimization)
