# Next Work Queue - @atomiton/nodes

## Priority 1 - Critical

### Phase 3: Extended Essential Nodes (Current Focus)

Based on ROADMAP.md Phase 3 requirements:

- [ ] File Reader Node - Read text/binary files with encoding detection
- [ ] File Writer Node - Write text/binary files with atomic operations
- [ ] Directory Scanner Node - Recursive traversal with glob patterns
- [ ] Webhook Receiver Node - HTTP server endpoint with validation

## Priority 2 - Important

### Phase 4: Control Flow Nodes

Following the ROADMAP.md Phase 4 plan:

- [ ] Conditional Node - Expression evaluation with multiple branches
- [ ] Loop Node - For/while/forEach patterns with break conditions
- [ ] Switch Node - Pattern matching with default branch
- [ ] Wait Node - Time-based delays and condition-based waiting
- [ ] Error Handler Node - Try-catch patterns with retry configuration

### Phase 5: AI/LLM Integration

AI-powered automation capabilities:

- [ ] LLM Chat Node - Multiple provider support with streaming
- [ ] Text Embedding Node - Vector generation with batch processing
- [ ] Vector Search Node - Similarity search with KNN queries
- [ ] Code Interpreter Node - Sandboxed execution environment
- [ ] Image Analysis Node - OCR and object detection

### Developer Experience

- [ ] Node creation CLI tool
- [ ] Node template generator
- [ ] Visual node builder
- [ ] Auto-generate node documentation

## Priority 3 - Nice to Have

### Advanced Features

- [ ] Custom node marketplace
- [ ] Node sharing system
- [ ] AI-powered node suggestions
- [ ] Node performance profiler

## Ideas Backlog

- WebAssembly nodes for performance
