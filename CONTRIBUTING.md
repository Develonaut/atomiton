# Contributing to Atomiton

First off, thank you for your interest in contributing to Atomiton! While the project is in very early stages, your feedback and ideas are invaluable.

## Current Project Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **VERY EARLY STAGE PROJECT** ‚ö†Ô∏è

Atomiton is currently in the "hopes and dreams" phase. Most features don't exist yet, and the codebase is rapidly evolving. Because of this, we have specific guidelines about contributions.

## How You Can Help Right Now

### ‚úÖ What We Welcome

1. **Ideas & Feedback**
   - Open an issue to discuss feature ideas
   - Share your use cases and workflows
   - Suggest improvements to the architecture
   - Report bugs (though most things don't work yet!)

2. **Documentation Review**
   - Point out unclear documentation
   - Suggest better explanations
   - Fix typos (via issues, not PRs yet)

3. **Community Building**
   - Star the repository if you're interested
   - Share the project with others who might be interested
   - Join discussions in issues

### ‚ùå What We're Not Ready For

1. **Code Contributions**
   - The codebase is changing too rapidly for external PRs
   - Core architecture decisions are still being made
   - We need to establish patterns before accepting contributions

2. **Feature Implementations**
   - Please discuss ideas in issues first
   - We're not ready to coordinate external development

3. **Major Refactors**
   - The structure is intentionally in flux

## When We'll Accept Code Contributions

We'll open up for code contributions when:

- Core architecture is stable
- Basic features are working
- Testing infrastructure is in place
- Contribution guidelines are established

We expect this to be several months away (optimistically).

## Reporting Issues

Even though the project is early, feel free to open issues for:

- Questions about the project vision
- Feature ideas and suggestions
- Documentation improvements
- Bugs (keeping in mind most things don't work)

### Issue Guidelines

When opening an issue:

1. Check if a similar issue exists
2. Use a clear, descriptive title
3. Provide context and examples where relevant
4. Be patient - this is a side project

## Development Setup

If you want to explore the codebase locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Develonaut/atomiton.git
cd atomiton
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Note: Expect things to be broken!

## Code of Conduct

Please note we have a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue for any questions about contributing. We appreciate your patience as the project grows from dreams to reality!
