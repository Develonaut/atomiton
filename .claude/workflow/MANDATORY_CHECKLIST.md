# ðŸš¨ MANDATORY PRE-WORK CHECKLIST ðŸš¨

## Before Starting ANY Work

1. **READ** [EXECUTION_PLAN.md](./EXECUTION_PLAN.md) - Contains the complete workflow
2. **CONFIRM**: State "I have read the AGENT_EXECUTION_PLAN and will follow the mandatory workflow"
3. **WORKTREE DECISION**:
   - **NEW feature/effort**: Create with `wtnew <feature-name>`
   - **Assisting/fixing/updating**: Use current worktree (DO NOT create new)
4. **USE TodoWrite** to track workflow steps from the execution plan

## The Execution Plan Defines

- Complete workflow steps (planning â†’ implementation â†’ review â†’ approval)
- Who to consult at each stage (Voorhees, Michael, Karen, Barbara)
- Quality requirements (format/lint/typecheck/build)
- When work is considered complete (Karen's approval)

**This is NOT optional. ALL work follows the execution plan.**
