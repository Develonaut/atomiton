# How to Properly Invoke Agents with Mandatory Workflow

## The Problem

Agents often skip the AGENT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md workflow, leading to incomplete or
non-compliant work.

## The Solution

When using the Task tool to invoke any agent, you MUST include the mandatory
workflow instructions in your prompt.

## Template for Agent Invocation

```python
# ALWAYS use this template when invoking agents:

Task(
    subagent_type="<agent-name>",
    description="<brief-description>",
    prompt="""
    ## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Follow Workflow Requirements ðŸš¨

    You MUST:
    1. Read and follow the mandatory workflow
    2. Get Voorhees to review approach BEFORE coding - "What's the SIMPLEST solution?"
    3. Create worktree ONLY if starting NEW feature (not for assisting)
    4. Use TodoWrite to track progress
    5. Complete [REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md](../../docs/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md) before marking done
    6. Get Karen's approval using checklist before calling work complete

    Quality Requirements:
    - Voorhees MUST approve simplicity before implementation
    - NO unnecessary complexity or over-engineering
    - NO `any` types in code
    - Remove ALL redundant comments
    - Break up files over 500 lines
    - Run: pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build

    **NOW, your specific task:**

    {actual_task_description}

    Remember: Start by reading the execution plan and confirming. No exceptions.

```

## Examples

### Example 1: UI Component Development

```python
Task(
    subagent_type="Ryan",
    description="Create new Button component",
    prompt="""
    [INSERT MANDATORY WORKFLOW TEMPLATE ABOVE]

    Create a new Button component following our Brainwave 2.0 design system.
    It should support variants: primary, secondary, ghost.
    """
)
```

### Example 2: Backend API Development

```python
Task(
    subagent_type="Michael",
    description="Design user authentication API",
    prompt="""
    [INSERT MANDATORY WORKFLOW TEMPLATE ABOVE]

    Design and implement a RESTful API for user authentication.
    Include endpoints for login, logout, and token refresh.
    """
)
```

## Verification Checklist

When an agent returns their work, verify:

- [ ] Did they confirm reading the execution plan?
- [ ] **Did Voorhees review and approve the approach for simplicity?**
- [ ] Did they create a worktree (if needed)?
- [ ] Did they use TodoWrite to track workflow steps?
- [ ] Did they follow ALL workflow steps in order?
- [ ] Did they complete the REVIEW_CHECKLIST?
- [ ] **Has unnecessary complexity been eliminated?**
- [ ] Are there NO `any` types in the code?
- [ ] Were redundant comments removed?
- [ ] Are all files < 500 lines?
- [ ] Do all quality checks pass (typecheck/lint/test/build)?
- [ ] Did they get Karen's approval using the checklist?
- [ ] Did they log progress to `.claude/LOG.md`?

If ANY of these are missing, the work is NOT complete.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **DON'T** invoke agents without the mandatory workflow prompt
2. **DON'T** accept work that skips workflow steps
3. **DON'T** let agents proceed without confirming they've read the plan
4. **DON'T** allow commits without explicit permission
5. **DON'T** accept "complete" status without Karen's approval

## Enforcement

If an agent doesn't follow the workflow:

1. Stop them immediately
2. Direct them back to the AGENT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md
3. Have them restart with proper workflow compliance
4. Document the issue in `.claude/LOG.md`

## Remember

The workflow is NOT optional. It's the foundation of our quality assurance
process. Every agent, every time, no exceptions.
