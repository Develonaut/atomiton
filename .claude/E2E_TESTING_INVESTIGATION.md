# E2E Testing Investigation Progress

**Date**: 2025-09-25 **Investigators**: Claude, Guilliman, Megamind **Status**:
In Progress

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

Our E2E tests are failing because:

1. Files aren't being written to tmp directory when execute button is pressed
2. Logger isn't writing logs to tmp/logs file during app startup/execution
3. Events aren't making it from browser conductor to desktop conductor
4. The conductor execution flow from browser to electron main process is broken

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Initial Findings** (Guilliman & Megamind)

**Guilliman** identified multiple standard tooling violations:

- Custom Electron helper instead of standard Playwright Electron APIs
- Over-engineered test setup with dual configuration files
- Manual file polling instead of Playwright's built-in async expectations
- Violation of standard test naming conventions

**Megamind** found the exact execution failure points:

- Main process event forwarding missing from IPC bridge to desktop conductor
- Silent service initialization failures due to poor error handling
- Desktop IPC process detection bug in environment detection
- Competing IPC handlers causing message interception

## ✅ **Issues RESOLVED**

### 1. **Desktop IPC Process Detection Bug** - FIXED ✅

**File**: `/packages/@atomiton/events/src/desktop/bridge/desktopIPCHandler.ts`
**Problem**: Custom environment detection using incorrect logic **Solution**:
Replaced with official Electron API using `process.type` and
`process.versions.electron`

```typescript
// BEFORE: Custom detection with multiple fallbacks
function detectElectronEnvironment(): "renderer" | "main" | null;

// AFTER: Official Electron API
function getElectronEnvironment(): "renderer" | "main" | null {
  if (typeof process === "undefined" || !process.versions?.electron) {
    return null;
  }
  return process.type === "renderer" ? "renderer" : "main";
}
```

### 2. **Logger File Writing Issue** - FIXED ✅

**File**: `/packages/@atomiton/logger/src/desktop/desktopLogger.ts` **Problem**:
Incorrect TSLogger log level mappings preventing INFO messages from being
written **Root Cause**: TSLogger uses different numeric levels than assumed:

- TSLogger: DEBUG=2, INFO=3, WARN=4, ERROR=5
- Our code: debug=0, info=2, warn=3, error=4 ❌

**Solution**: Fixed log level mappings and default level

```typescript
// BEFORE: Wrong mappings
minLevel: config.level === "debug"
  ? 0
  : config.level === "info"
    ? 2
    : config.level === "warn"
      ? 3
      : 4;

// AFTER: Correct TSLogger mappings
minLevel: config.level === "debug"
  ? 2
  : config.level === "info"
    ? 3
    : config.level === "warn"
      ? 4
      : 5;
```

**Verification**: Logs now writing to `/tmp/logs/atomiton.log` with color-coded
formatting ✅

### 3. **Duplicate IPC Handlers** - FIXED ✅

**File**: `/apps/desktop/src/main/index.ts` **Problem**: Main process had its
own IPC handler competing with desktop conductor's IPC handler **Solution**:
Removed duplicate handler, letting conductor's event bus handle IPC
communication

### 4. **Service Initialization Logging** - IMPROVED ✅

**File**: `/apps/desktop/src/main/services/conductor.ts` **Enhancement**: Added
comprehensive logging and proper error handling

- Added initialization start/success messages
- Enhanced error logging with full error details
- Changed from silent `return null` to proper error throwing

## ❌ **Issues REMAINING**

### 1. **IPC Bridge Still Not Available** - IN PROGRESS ❌

**Current Status**: `IPC not available, auto-forwarding disabled` **Evidence**:
Desktop conductor initializes but IPC bridge fails to become available
**Impact**: Browser-to-main process communication still broken **Next Steps**:
Need deeper investigation into IPC module loading

### 2. **E2E Test Framework Over-Engineering** - IDENTIFIED ❌

**Current Status**: Multiple violations of Playwright best practices identified
**Issues**:

- Custom ElectronTestHelper (98 lines) vs standard Playwright Electron APIs
- Dual configuration files vs single config with projects
- Manual file polling vs Playwright async expectations
- Hard-coded absolute paths vs Playwright fixtures

## 📊 **Current Test Results**

### **Desktop App Startup** ✅

- Conductor initializes successfully
- Storage service working
- Logging to file operational
- Window creation functional

### **IPC Communication** ❌

- Browser conductor sends events
- IPC bridge receives messages
- **FAILURE**: Main process IPC handler not available
- Desktop conductor never receives execution requests

### **File Creation** ❌

- Execute button triggers browser conductor ✅
- Events sent via IPC bridge ✅
- **FAILURE**: Events don't reach desktop conductor ❌
- No file creation in tmp directory ❌

## 🔄 **STRATEGIC PIVOT: Migration to electron-trpc**

### **Decision Rationale**

After Guilliman's research revealed that `electron-trpc` is the industry
standard for exactly our use case, we've decided to **abandon custom IPC
implementation** and fully migrate to electron-trpc. This will:

- ✅ Replace all custom IPC bridge complexity with standard tooling
- ✅ Provide type-safe communication between renderer and main processes
- ✅ Eliminate the need for custom event forwarding and auto-forwarding logic
- ✅ Solve the "IPC not available" issue with proven, maintained solution
- ✅ Enable proper conductor orchestration using established patterns

### **Migration Plan**

### **Phase 1: Install and Setup electron-trpc**

- Add electron-trpc dependencies to packages
- Configure tRPC router in main process for conductor operations
- Set up tRPC client in renderer process

### **Phase 2: Migrate Conductor Package**

- Replace custom IPC bridge with tRPC calls in browserConductor.ts
- Update desktopConductor.ts to use tRPC server patterns
- Maintain existing conductor API while changing transport layer

### **Phase 3: Simplify Events Package**

- Remove custom IPC bridge implementation
- Use tRPC subscriptions for event-based communication
- Eliminate auto-forwarding complexity

### **Phase 4: Update E2E Tests**

- Use standard Playwright Electron APIs (as Guilliman recommended)
- Test conductor execution through tRPC instead of custom IPC
- Implement proper async waiting patterns

### **Phase 5: Clean Up**

- Remove unused custom IPC code
- Update documentation
- Verify all functionality works through tRPC

## 📁 **Files Modified**

1. `/packages/@atomiton/events/src/desktop/bridge/desktopIPCHandler.ts` -
   Environment detection fix
2. `/packages/@atomiton/logger/src/desktop/desktopLogger.ts` - Log level
   mappings fix
3. `/apps/desktop/src/main/index.ts` - Added back IPC handler for immediate fix
4. `/apps/desktop/src/main/services/conductor.ts` - Enhanced logging

## 🏗️ **electron-trpc Migration Progress**

### **Architectural Decision**

- ✅ tRPC dependencies installed in **conductor package** (not apps)
- ✅ Conductor package will handle all tRPC communication internally
- ✅ Apps will use conductor's clean API without knowing about tRPC

### **Dependencies Added to Conductor Package**

```json
"@trpc/client": "^11.6.0",
"@trpc/server": "^11.6.0",
"electron-trpc": "^0.7.1"
```

### **Migration Status - COMPLETED** ✅

- [x] Dependencies installed in Events package (architectural decision: Events
      handles transport)
- [x] tRPC transport layer created in Events package
- [x] Desktop event bus updated to use tRPC transport
- [x] Browser event bus updated to use tRPC client
- [x] Preload script configured for tRPC
- [x] Conductor package remains transport-agnostic
- [x] Desktop app passes BrowserWindows to conductor

### **Architecture Clarification**

Per user guidance:

- **Events Package**: Handles HOW messages move (transport layer via tRPC)
- **Conductor Package**: Defines WHAT operations happen (orchestration layer)
- Events exposes simple `emit`/`on` API regardless of underlying transport

## 🧪 **SYSTEMATIC TESTING PLAN**

### **Level 1: Component Isolation Tests**

#### **Test 1.1: tRPC Transport Initialization**

```javascript
// Test that tRPC transport initializes in desktop process
// Location: apps/desktop/src/main/index.ts
console.log("TEST 1.1: Checking tRPC transport...");
console.log("- Windows passed:", mainWindow ? "YES" : "NO");
console.log("- Event bus created:", !!services.conductor.events);
console.log("- tRPC available:", services.conductor.events.ipc?.isAvailable());
```

#### **Test 1.2: Event Bus Communication**

```javascript
// Test that events can be emitted and received locally
// Location: packages/@atomiton/conductor/src/desktop/conductor/desktopConductor.ts
events.on("test:ping", (data) => {
  console.log("TEST 1.2: Received ping:", data);
});
events.emit("test:ping", { message: "local test" });
```

#### **Test 1.3: Preload Script tRPC Exposure**

```javascript
// Test that tRPC is properly exposed in preload
// Location: apps/desktop/src/preload/index.ts
console.log(
  "TEST 1.3: tRPC exposed:",
  typeof exposeElectronTRPC === "function",
);
```

### **Level 2: Cross-Process Communication Tests**

#### **Test 2.1: Renderer to Main Process**

```javascript
// Test message from renderer to main
// Location: apps/client - in browser console
window.electron?.ipcRenderer?.send("test:message", { from: "renderer" });
```

#### **Test 2.2: Main to Renderer Process**

```javascript
// Test message from main to renderer
// Location: apps/desktop/src/main/index.ts
mainWindow.webContents.send("test:message", { from: "main" });
```

#### **Test 2.3: Conductor Execute Request**

```javascript
// Test conductor execution request flow
// Location: browser console
// Emit a test execution request and verify it reaches desktop conductor
```

### **Level 3: Integration Tests**

#### **Test 3.1: Execute Button Without File Writing**

- Click execute button
- Verify browser conductor receives click
- Verify event is emitted
- Verify desktop conductor receives request
- Don't test file writing yet

#### **Test 3.2: File Writing in Isolation**

- Test file writing directly from desktop conductor
- Verify tmp directory exists and is writable
- Test with simple content first

#### **Test 3.3: Full Execute Button Flow**

- Complete end-to-end test with file creation
- Verify file contents match expected

## 🔄 **Current Status Analysis**

### **What's Working** ✅

- tRPC dependencies installed and building
- Transport layer implemented in Events package
- Preload script updated with tRPC
- Desktop app initializes with windows
- All packages build without errors

### **What's Failing** ❌

- **Visual E2E Test**: `/editor/test-blueprint` route returns error page
- **Desktop App Startup**: ESM module error - `__dirname` not defined in
  electron-trpc vendor code
- **IPC Communication**: Can't test - app doesn't start due to ESM error
- **Root Cause**: electron-trpc using CommonJS patterns (`__dirname`) in ESM
  context

## ✅ **ESM/CommonJS Incompatibility - FIXED**

### **Solution Applied**

1. Removed `"type": "module"` from desktop app package.json ✅
2. Added CommonJS exports to all packages that desktop app uses:
   - conductor package: Added `"require": "./dist/desktop/index.cjs"` ✅
   - storage package: Added CJS exports for all subpaths ✅
   - utils package: Added `"require": "./dist/index.cjs"` ✅
   - events package: Already had CJS exports ✅
   - logger package: Already had CJS exports ✅

### **Current Blocker: electron-trpc Monorepo Issue**

**Error**: "Electron failed to install correctly" **Root Cause**: electron-trpc
is bundled in conductor package but trying to require Electron which is only
installed in desktop app **Impact**: This is a known limitation of electron-trpc
in monorepos - it expects Electron to be in the same package

### **Verification**

- Logger is working and writing to
  `/Users/Ryan/Code/atomiton/tmp/logs/atomiton.log` ✅
- Desktop app builds without ESM errors ✅
- All packages have proper CJS/ESM dual exports ✅

## 🔄 **Status Summary**

- **2/4 Core Issues**: RESOLVED ✅ (Logger, Environment Detection)
- **2/4 Core Issues**: MIGRATED BUT UNTESTED ⏳ (IPC, Conductor)
- **Logger**: OPERATIONAL ✅
- **tRPC Migration**: COMPLETE BUT UNTESTED ⏳
